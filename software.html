	<p>
		For over a year now, I've been working at the same job.  It's a pretty
		good job.  I make enough to pay the bills and still have spending
		money, I'm doing something I generally enjoy, and I don't have much of
		a commute.  My job title is 'Information Technology Developer.'  I do a
		lot of different things, but my core duties revolve around writing
		software.  As someone who deals daily with writing, implementing, and
		modifying software, I have some opinions on the subject.
	</p>

	<h4>free software</h4>
	<p>
		The company where I work is a "Microsoft shop," and uses proprietary
		software almost exclusively.  My boss' take on our reasons for this is
		that we cannot afford to implement a system based on free software,
		because administrating and supporting such a system is more expensive
		in human resources.  I have slowly come to hold the opposite opinion:
		not only do proprietary information systems have a higher monetary cost
		(price tag,) they also consume more human resources.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most well-designed software functions essentially as a <a
		href='black_box'>black box</a>, providing simple
		services such as text processing, data munging, or network operations.
		This software is useful because it is predictable and can be replaced
		with a more efficient system seamlessly.  That is, the old interface
		continues to work, although it may have been extended.  To some extent,
		proprietary software is occasionally designed this way, but in
		proprietary software, additions may be made, but core componants may
		not be replaced.
	</p>

	<p>
		In giving thought to the question of <a
		href='freedom'>software freedom</a>, I have concluded
		that the current, popular method of developing software -- that is, the
		idea of a corporation which exists solely to produce software -- is
		only beneficial to the software company.  New methods, already
		existing, need to become the norm for the sake of all users.
	</p>

	<h4>programming languages</h4>
	<p>
		I've picked up a <a href='helloworld'>few</a> languages
		over the years, though I haven't managed to grok any of the in
		fullness.  I program mostly in <a href='http://www.perl.com'>perl</a>,
		though <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org'>ruby</a> is quickly becoming
		my new favorite.
