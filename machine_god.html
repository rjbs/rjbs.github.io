	<p>
		Born in the summer of 1998, the Church of the Machine God was a proud but
		short-lived venture undertaken by Brothers OT (that's me), <a
		href='kevin'>Kevin</a>, S&oslash;ren, and Drew.
	</p>

	<p>
		It all began when Kevin and I finally decided that we'd get an apartment after our
		leases expired.  Until September '98 he was in an overpriced studio in Allston and
		I was in a free but mouse-infested Boston University apartment.  As summer wore
		on, we began to plan for the setup and rules of our apartment.  (We had secured
		the lease sometime in July, if memory serves me right.)  Chief in our designs was
		the idea of a decent LAN and a good A/V setup.  We had some NICs and a hub, but we
		needed more.  Like any good Bostonian geeks, we made the rounds at the <a
		href='http://web.mit.edu/w1mx/www/swapfest.html'>MIT Flea</a>, where all manner of
		hardware could be had cheap.
	</p>

	<p>
		Between a few hundred dollars at the flea and generous donations or sales by
		friends, we managed to assemble a decent system in the house:
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>living room</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>six 20" televisions (five worked, one was a 1960's motorola that just looked great)</li>
				<li>a tiny 4" combination TV/radio which never worked</li>
				<li>two VHS VCR's</li>
				<li>a betamax VCR</li>
				<li>a DVD player</li>
				<li>a laserdisc player which was twitchy but operable</li>
				<li>a pentium/75 (gregory-thaumaturgus)</li>
				<li>a 50 CD jukebox</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>kitchen</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>a 13" television</li>
				<li>a VT202</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>library</dt>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>a 486/66 (john)</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
		After a month, or so, in the apartment, Kevin and I bought a new, 36" flat-screen
		Panasonic television with two-tuner picture-in-picture.  This television, The Good
		Book, became the centerpiece of the living room, and the focus of much adoring
		worship (for so we called our slavish devotion to cable TV and console gaming.)
	</p>

	<p>
		The idea was, in the end, to create an intranet application that would let you use
		<a href='http://www.tvguide.com'>TV Guide online</a> listings to program any of
		the house's common TV's or VCR's.  There were numerous setbacks, though.  The
		biggest was that none of us knew enough of any decent programming language to
		write the application to do it.  (S&oslash;ren was somewhat proficient in
		JavaScript, but not enough at that point.)  Another crippling factor was our
		inability to find any good information on how to build a computer-controller
		remote control.
	</p>

	<p> 
		Failing these two essentials, we instead just watched a lot of TV and played a lot
		of Nintendo.  Our games of choice were <cite class='video_game'>007:
		Goldeneye</cite> and <cite class='video_game'>MarioKart 64</cite>.  (There was
		also a Playstation, but it was used mostly for FF7 and then left alone.)  One
		television was mostly devoted to the <a
		href='http://www.historychannel.com'>History Channel</a> and known as The Nazi
		Television because of History's then-policy of "all WWII, all the time."  
	</p>

	<p>
		The LAN went up almost before we had any furniture, and was used almost
		exclusively for playing <a href='http://www.blizzard.com/starcraft'>StarCraft</a>
		over IPX.  There was no high-speed internet in our area and neither Kevin nor I
		felt the urge to set up IP masquerading to share a 56k connection, so there was,
		instead, a fifty foot telephone cable that was always running to one of our rooms
		for network connections.  For a long time, that was our only line, and it led to
		many, many busy signals for our friends and family.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Shortly after Kevin died and S&oslash;ren left (these happened within days of each
		other), Drew moved in.  We quickly set up a shared dial-up and a second phone
		line, but as this part of the Machine God grew toward fruition, the greater parts
		faded away.  We sold or gave away several of the A/V componants to make money and
		room, and soon had only two televisions in the living room.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, with none of the original Brotherhood still residing together and the pieces
		of the Machine God scattered to the four winds, only the dream remains alive --
		the dream that someday we may all have so many televisions that we can't even
		think of a reason to turn some of them on.  (The Good Book lives, too.  It's still
		with me, and still an object of great charisma.  After all, it's connected to the
		GameCube!)
