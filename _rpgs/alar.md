When I was having trouble getting a new tabletop game going, I started to
grumble that it would be a lot easier to get a game going online.  Instead of
telling me to quit whining, a few friends encouraged me to get to work on
starting one.  I started poking at notes for a setting and stories, but I kept
not doing anything about it, because I couldn't find software I liked to
actually run the thing online.  Finally, my friend Nick got sick of my inaction
and found suitable software.  I announced in March 2011 that we'd start play
soon.  Then I did nothing again for a few months, but the game finally started
happening in November 2011.

We played every other Saturday for about two years before (for various reasons)
the same set of players began playing Basic D&D instead, moving into my [Beyond
the Temple of the Abyss](/rpg/beyond) campaign.

I kept [a journal of game recaps](https://rjbs.cloud/tags/#rpg-alar).

## System

<!-- <img class='lefty' src='../../images/mazes-small.jpg'></img> -->

We played [Mazes & Minotaurs
(Revised)](http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/revised.html) the 1987 (but really
2007) old-school RPG of [sword and
sandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sandal) adventure.  The rules
are available free online, and you can print it at your local copy center for a
few bucks, if you like paper.

Mazes & Minotaurs is a very simple system, with a feel something like early
AD&D, but with a lot more "roll a d20 based on your attributes" than that.
Characters have six attributes, a bunch of derived bonuses, a class, and that's
about it.  If you're a really complicated character, you might have a list of
spells.

Of course, I also have a bunch of [house rules](#house-rules).

## Tools

We played using two main tools:  [Mumble](https://www.mumble.info/) for voice
chat and [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) for maps, minis, and dice.  They
worked pretty well.

## Setting

<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5014/5494444760_4ba67eed86_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="&quot;Alar&quot; - the western Castaign empire"/></a>

Alar was set in the massive city of Alar, one of the largest cities in the
sprawling and powerful Castaigne Empire.  In recent months, the city had become
more and more crowded with refugees fleeing the mysterious spire that erupted
from the earth, bringing with it terrible creatures and a spreading chaos.
Alar had been left cut off from the seat of the empire, and the situation had
grown even more tense and dangerous than usual as players on all sides –
including the player characters – tried to use the situation to their
advantage.

## House Rules

(I have provided some links for origins of house rules below, but surely missed
some.)

### Close-Quarters Combat

Missile weapons are not meant for use in melee combat.  Doing so causes
attacks to occur at the same time as melee attacks, and also invites a free
attack by flanking enemies.

### Carousing

I use Jeff's [rules for
carousing](http://jrients.blogspot.com/2008/12/party-like-its-999.html).  In
brief, characters can spend a lot of gold on debauchery and convert it into
experience.  This runs the risk of drunken mishaps, however, so drink
responsibly.  I put [the current rules for carousing in Alar into git](
https://github.com/rjbs/RPG-Alar/blob/master/Misc/Carousing.mkdn).

### Critical Hits & Fumbles

A natural 20 on the 'to-hit' roll indicates a critical strike.  Roll
damage.  If the damage die shows the maximum value, roll again and add it.
Repeat until the die's result isn't the maximum.  If the first die shows
less than the die's maximum, use the die's maximum value.  A natural 1
indicates a fumble, and something bad happens.

### Friends, we are gathered here today to mourn the passing of Bob's cleric.  What was his name again?

When an adventurer dies and the party is unable (or unwilling!) to have
them raised from the dead, a promoted sidekick (see above) may opt to give
the corpse a Heroic Sendoff.  This requires at least 24 hours and something
cool like a bigass funeral pyre, the raising of a burial mound, or a
funeral ship floated down the river.  The corpse must be armed and armored
for combat, as appropriate to the class of the character.  Each party
member may donate up to 100 sp times the level of the stiff as additional
grave goods, the amount being spent is converted to bonus XP for the donor.
Each party member may also donate one magic item to the grave.  Scrolls,
potions, and other one-shot items net a bonus of 100xp, while more
permanent items get you 500xp.  Magic items that would have been unusable
by the deceased do not count.

### Shields Shall Be Splintered!

This rule comes from
[Trollsmyth](http://trollsmyth.blogspot.com/2008/05/shields-shall-be-splintered.html).
With this houserule, you get the usual +1 to your EDC with a shield.  However,
any time you take damage, you can opt instead to say your shield absorbed the
force of the blow.  The shield is shattered and must be discarded, but you
don't take any damage from that hit.

### Stunts and Called Shots

If you want to do something totally awesome, you can shift down the
threshold for a critical hit by shifting up the threshold for a critical
failures.  In other words, you can say that you'll crit on a 18-20, but
then you'll fumble on a 1-3.

### Role-Playing XP Bonus

Characters progress faster when they do what they're best at.  Be an
exemplar of your class and get a 10% - 20% bonus to your experience for the
session.

### Clerics: Pick a Faith

Priests must have a declared allegiance to [of the setting's
deities](https://github.com/rjbs/RPG-Alar/tree/master/Pantheon).
