title: Complexity and Deliverance
---

*Complexity* and *Deliverance* were two distinct campaigns set in the same game
world and at the same time, with different groups and focuses.  The party in
Complexity, run in Philadelphia at the Pobox offices, was a special ops team
working for a shadowy government agency.  Deliverance, run in Allentown at my
friend's dog kennel, was more of a space smugglers game, where the characters
tried to pull off high-paying jobs organized by their fixer.  In both cases,
the campaign were named after the party's spaceship.

## System

We used the Storyteller System, as seen in the second edition World of Darkness
games.  (Do not confuse it with the Storytell*ing* System, which came later.)
I always liked that system, and felt like it was a good fit here.  I probably
had some house rules, but they're lost to time.  Really, most were not needed,
since most things could be translated into dice pools.

## Setting

As usual, I had a lot of notes about too much history.  Sometimes it was
useful, but often it just let me feel like I knew what kind of nonsense I could
pull out of left field, when needed.  For example, the game was set in 3175 (or
160, in game), but my notes include "1989: Second American Revolution" and the
name of the first man on Mars.  I guess I had a lot of energy.

The short version is something like "Alien and Cyberpunk meet Firefly, with a
healthy dose of Paranoia".  I enjoyed it.
