	<h3>editing lines</h3>
	<p>
		The first text editor I ever used was the BASIC shell on our Texas
		Instruments 99.  Granted, editing text was only a side job, but it
		was still a text editor.  (I suppose I could even call it an IDE.) The
		TI99's BASIC was a line editor, and it was the only one that I ever
		used.  Unless it is the only feasible way I can perform editing, I will
		not use line editors.  Very few files are structly line-oriented, and
		even those files can usually better edited if I can see more than one
		line at once.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have forgotten almost everything I knew about the next editor I used,
		kedit.  Kedit was a clone of XEDIT, IBM's default editor on CPM.  My
		father used XEDIT on his office's mainframes, so he wanted to use
		something familiar on DOS.  Kedit was <dfn>modal</dfn>, meaning that
		there was a mode for typing and a mode for moving around and executing
		commands.  As I was probably only about eight or nine, I wasn't very
		interested in commands beyond "open," "save," "quit," and maybe "find."
		Apparently, XEDIT and kedit have powerful REXX interpreters built in,
		along with heaps of other features that keep many programmers addicted,
		to this very day.  (There's even a GPL clone of XEDIT, 
		<a href='http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/'>THE</a>.)
	</p>

	<h3>italics warp my mind</h3>
	<p>
		I, too, might have learned to harness the power of REXX (such as it
		is), had I not been seduced by the evil twin of text editing:  word
		processing.  Word processing is one of those terms that is never very
		clearly defined.  I offer the following definition:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>word processor</dt>
		<dd>
			a computer program that combines the least useful aspects of text
			editing, typesetting, and desktop publishing software with a user
			interface that prohibits end-users from understanding what they're
			doing
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
		A nicely typeset and formatted document is useful because the look of
		its text provides clues to the significance of the document and its
		parts.  If all definitions are green, they're easy to pick out.  If all
		chapter headings occur on otherwise empty pages, they're easy to pick
		out, too.  Humanity has been decorating its text for just about as long
		as it's been writing.  Word processors are nearly always designed with
		a focus on letting users directly map formatting to text, without the
		mediating layer of semantics.  It's up to the end user to remember that
		definitions are green and headers are bold.  Even if you can remember,
		it becomes a nightmare to change your mind after writing a few hundred
		pages.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, I was only eight or nine.  I probably didn't know what
		semantics were, but I did know that it was really cool to be able to
		print in bold and italics.  So, I latched onto my dad's text editor of
		choice, Textra.  Textra was made by a little company called Ann Arbor
		Software, and I remember its logo very clearly;  the labels on the
		5.25" disks on which it was shipped were printed with little Charlie
		Chaplin-style hats and canes.  At some point, my father got into their
		beta program -- that's how I learned about beta testing -- and we
		always had a new version of Textra.  It ran in 80 by 25 text mode, with
		a status line at the top and bottom, as well as an on-screen display of
		available keyboard commands, leaving 22 rows for editing.  It used
		color to show you how text had been marked up, but on the tiny CRT in
		our luggable, everything was shades of green.
	</p>

	<p>
		I stuck with Textra for years.  I used it to write just about
		everything other than C code until I high school, when I switched to
		Microsoft Word v2.0, running on Windows.  MS Word's huge advantage was
		<acronym>WYSIWYG</acronym> editing, in which What You See Is What
		You Get.  WYSIWYG made it easier to understand what you really did when
		you increased the font size on a paragraph or changed the page's
		margins.  Unfortunately, it didn't do much to encourage practical
		semantic markup.  The ability was there -- Styles -- but nobody used
		it.  For the most part, nobody even knew about it.  At my office,
		nearly no one knows about styles in MS Word, and that includes people
		who use it to perform their primary job functions.  Why?  I think word
		processing was based in a culture of ignorance, in which the users were
		protected from semantic formatting.  "Want to write a business letter?
		Click here!"
	</p>

	<h3>Borland saves my soul</h3>
	<p>
		At some point when I was pretty young, we acquired a copy of Borland C,
		which was later replaced with <a
		href='http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,20841,00.html'>Borland
		Turbo C</a>.  I was probably around ten or eleven.  Turbo C included
		its own IDE, and I used that to write my code.  The IDE's text editor
		was extremely simple:  you could search, replace, move, and edit.  It
		was <em>not</em> modal.  I was still using kedit to make modifications
		to things like AUTOEXEC.BAT, and I know that it seemed to make more
		sense as an editor than the Borland IDE.  Of course, Borland's editor
		was so well integrated with the compiler and debugger than I was happy
		to have it, and used it for all my coding.  When I played around with
		Pascal, I use the Turbo Pascal IDE -- it was familiar.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Eventually, MS-DOS 6 shipped, and kedit was replaced with EDIT.COM,
		which was a serviceable, though mediocre editor.  It was <em>much</em>
		more like Borland than kedit, so I grew comfortable using simple
		non-modal editors.  Under Windows, I used MultiEdit, which was
		basically just Notepad with multiple windows.  Notepad, I will now
		note, is possibly the most hateful of all text ediors.  It was from
		Notepad that I first learned that Windows was not for programmers.
	</p>

	<p>
		It wasn't long after the release of Windows 3 that I stopped writing
		much code and started running Linux.  The default editor under nearly
		every program in Slackware 3 was vi.  In 1995, vi was, in my mind, "the
		editor that beeps."  I could probably have made most of my programs use
		something else by changing the EDITOR variable in my login script, but
		I didn't know that.  So, typically, I would try to, say, send an email
		and see vi run.  I would then spend ten minutes trying to quit before
		finally suspending and killing vi so that I could get into the
		program's options.  Pretty soon, <a
		href='http://space.mit.edu/~davis/jed/'>jed</a> became my editor of
		choice.
	</p>

	<p>
		Jed was a screen editor that acted, at least in its default
		configuration, a lot like EMACS.  It used the <a
		href='http://www.s-lang.org/'>S-Lang</a> macro language for
		extensibility, and had lots of flashy features:  syntax highlighting, a
		clipboard, multiple windows, and so on.  It reminded me of the Borland
		editor, but was much more powerful.  I used Jed until shortly after I
		started college.  
	</p>

	<p>
		BU did not provide Jed on its AIX and SunOS machines.  I briefly tried
		to use EMACS, but the thought of installing megs and megs of Slackware
		packages just for a text editor appaled me.  Anyway, EMACS wasn't
		available on all of BU's systems, either.  I chose, and I chose,
		poorly;  I switched to pico.  Pico gave me all the interface klunkiness
		of Textra with none of the features.  Sure, it could search, replace,
		and spell-check, but it didn't do much more than that.  Worse yet,
		while it was on most of the BU systems, because they had Pine, it
		wasn't on quite a few of the other systems I was starting to use.  As I
		got back into programming and system administration, I needed something
		that was even more common and more powerful.  I reverted to vi!
	</p>

	<h3>vi: via, lux, veritas</h3>

	<p>
		As the first screen-based text editor written, vi (the
		<strong>vi</strong>sual editor), became a standard part of UNIX, and is
		required for <acronym title='Portable Operating System
		Interface'>POSIX</acronym> systems.  It's modal, like kedit, split
		mostly between "command mode" and "insert mode."  (Also known as "the
		mode that beeps" and "the mode that doesn't beep.")  It's a little hard
		to learn -- remember that it was easier for me to kill the process than
		to remember how to quit -- but once you've learned the basic concepts,
		everything else follows logically.  I started with elvis, the vi clone
		that ships with slackware, but once I tried <a
		href='http://vim.sf.net'>vim</a>, I was forever converted.  Vim is a
		modern, extended clone of vi, and I've used it for about two years.
	</p>

	<p>
		Most of my job is programming and documenting, and I spend a good
		amount of time at home doing both as well.  I'm actually so used to
		vim, now, that I find myself hitting ESC in Outlook's email editor and
		at my IRC client's prompt.  The former is really annoying, because
		Outlook thinks I want to abort my message, and asks, "Do you want to
		save changes?"  Naturally, I can't change my default email editor,
		unless I want to use Word.  Typical!
