## Abstract

Data validation is a real pain, but it's a huge help in preventing bugs. By
using one system for validating data everywhere, the burden of validation is
greatly simplified.

Rx is a schema language that can be used to validate data structures anywhere
in your Perl programs. It integrates with Moose types, is extremely extensible,
and is portable across languages: Rx implementations also exist in Python,
Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript.
