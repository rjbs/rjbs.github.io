## Abstract

After five releases of Perl 5, Ricardo Signes has stepped down as pumpking. In
this address, Rik will reflect on his accomplishments, rest on his laurels, and
fall on his sword. Mostly, though, he'll talk about the changes in perl v5.24.0
and some of the changes yet to come.

## Notes

I'm writing this in early 2026.  It's hard to believe I retired as pumpking
*ten years ago*!  The title intentionally expresses my eye-rolling annoyance at
the complaints that we weren't doing whatever the complainer wanted.  I think
we did great work during my tenure, and I hope I did a good job showing them
off while also showing where we failed.  But I'm not going to rewatch this now
to find out.
