## Abstract

Ready? 250 OK! Everybody loves email, right? Right! What better language than
Perl for handling all your email needs? None, right? Right! After all, with
about nine hundred email modules on the CPAN, the only question is: which tool
is right for the job?

This year, the Perl Email Project is going to tell you what's what. We'll see
what modules solve what problems, how they differ, and how they (may or my not)
work together.

We'll also show what problems aren't well-solved, what is in the works to make
it happen, and how you can help.
