## Abstract

If you're following along with email standards, you know about JMAP: it
replaces both IMAP and SMTP-for-sending, eliminating a lot of weird and dated
protocol design with HTTP and JSON. It makes easy things easy, and also enables
fast, efficient offline synchronization. It's not a new email system, just a
new access protocol.

But did you know that JMAP can also handle your calendars, your address book,
your files, and plenty more things to come? This talk will describe JMAP
extensions for those systems: what they are, how they work, and why you should
be excited.

## Notes

I wrote this talk for the third Modern Email dev room at FOSDEM in 2026.  The
Modern Email room's talks tend to be quite short and packed together, so I
wanted to do something that would some attention.  I wanted it to make "do
stuff with JMAP" feel approachable and exciting, and I wanted people to
remember it later -- since they'd have a few more hours of talks after mine.  I
think it went pretty well!

Also, I should admit:  I'm not really a bit kaiju fan.  I did really like Shin
Godzilla, but those older Toho movies are… rough.
