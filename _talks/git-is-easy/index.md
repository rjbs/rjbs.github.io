## Abstract

This has been a good year for Git. More and more open source projects --
including perl5 and rakudo perl6 -- are moving their source code to Git
repositories, and "patches welcome" is slowly being replaced with "tell me
where to pull from."

There's been some loose talk suggesting that Git is highly complex and has a
bizarre interface that makes it difficult to learn. This is completely and
entirely false, mostly.

This talk will explain how to get started with git, how it works, and how to
think about git in order to really know what you're doing.

## Notes

This talk is a subset of a full-day tutorial I did on how to use Git, from the
command line tools to the object model.  I think I never published the slides
because I thought I'd do the talk more often for pay.  I may put them up,
sometime, but honestly… there are a lot of Git tutorials these days!
