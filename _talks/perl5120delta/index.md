## Abstract

Perl 5.12 is here! It brings a number of cool new features that everyone can
use as well as a lot of internal improvements that only five people on the
planet understand. This talk only focuses on the first, so that you can skip
reading the detailed release notes and just start using the cool stuff seen
here.
