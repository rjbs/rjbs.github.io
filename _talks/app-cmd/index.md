## Abstract

It's easy to write command-line programs in Perl.  There are a million option
parsers to choose from, and Perl makes it easy to deal with input, output, and
all that stuff.

Once your program has gotten beyond just taking a few switches, though, it can
be difficult to maintain a clear interface and well-tested code.  App::Cmd is a
lightweight framework for writing easy to manage CLI programs.

This talk provides an introduction to writing programs with App::Cmd.

## Notes

Another talk from the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop (PPW), whose schedule has
vanished.
