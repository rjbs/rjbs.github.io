## Abstract

Perl 5.22 is here, and it's got new stuff. What kind of new stuff? Cool new
stuff. You can read the fifty page perl5220delta document, or you can come
listen to the Perl 5 project manager summarize the stuff you actually care
about. We'll also review some of the major changes from 5.20 and just maybe a
little bit about what's coming next year.

## Notes

Really phoned it in on the abstract there, didn't I?
