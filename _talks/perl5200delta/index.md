## Notes

This talk was a lot of fun, because I felt great about the 5.20 release.  It
had so many practical improvements that I felt sure I'd use all the time.  Over
ten years later, I am still using them and still happy to have them.

One notable bit:  I made the joke, "It's 2014 and we don't have subroutine
signatures -- what is this, Fortran?"  The payoff, that Fortran *did* have
signatures, was on the next slide.  I didn't need it, though, because Larry
Wall was in the audience, and shouted it out for me.
