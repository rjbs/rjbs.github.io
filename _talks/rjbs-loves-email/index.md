## Abstract

Ok, email is a horrible technology with impossible technical specifications,
implementations that are broken in seriously incompatible ways, and massive
security issues that have led to a 9:1 noise to signal ratio. It stinks and
makes me want to kill.

...but who am I kidding? I love email. It presents fun challenges, and along
with the web is the internet medium most used by users of all types, each with
their own needs.

This talk will review a few new Email:: modules developed in the last year and
suitable for anybody who has to do stuff with email. Among these are
Email::Sender, Email::MIME::Kit, and Email::ARF.
