## Abstract

Unix was long a system learned through oral tradition, its philosophy handed
down from sysop to sysop.  The success of the GNU/Linux system has overwhelmed
this tradition, though, and many Unix users are left adrift, using Unix without
understanding it.  This talk will explain how to use Unix like Unix, with a
focus on the toolkit, pipelines, and shell scripts.

## Notes

I'm pretty sure I gave this talk to the Lehigh Valley Linux Users Group (LVLUG)
in around 2009, but I can't be sure.  Weirdly, there are no mentions of it in
my own email?  How did I arrange to give the talk?!
