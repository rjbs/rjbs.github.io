## Abstract

Every new release of Perl comes with a big list of changes, plenty of which
seem carefully worded to make the average Perl programmer wonder, "Wait, do I
care about this? What the heck is the global interpreter phase?" Perl 5.14 is
chocked full of great improvements will actually be useful in day to day
programming, and this talk focuses on those, leaving the weird esoterica for
another day.
