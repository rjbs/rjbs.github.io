## Abstract

Encoding is the worstÃ¢ÂÂ¼

At first it seems simple â you just add "\_utf8" to some methods, and things
work. Later, you realize that there's a "UTF8 flag" that governs whether things
will work. Everything gets better! &amp;#x1F603;

Except then people start telling you that you're an idiot, and that this flag
isn't anything to do with Unicode. (They don't listen when you remind them
about its name!)

Why is encoding so stupid? Why is perl so stupid? Why is everyone involved so
stupid? Who might exist, stupid enough to try to communicate the answers to
these questions?

I'm here to help.

## Notes

I gave this talk twice.  Once as a fifty minute talk (that ran to nearly double
length because they let me back up against lunch) and once as a three hour
tutorial.  Sadly, the video is for the shorter version.  The longer one covered
far more topics, and spent less time on "how to do this in Perl".  I'd love to
do this talk again, maybe even as a full day workshop.  Unicode is part of how
we model real human culture into computers, and it's important that we don't
force people to cut the corners off of their culture!
