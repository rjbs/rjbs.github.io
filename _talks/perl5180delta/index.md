## Abstract

In Perl 5’s development, all changes land in the “blead” branch first: the
bleading edge. Each year, more of these changes escape the blead branch and
land in the year’s stable release of perl. Over the course of that year,
they’re tested, argued over, redesigned, and then either accepted or rejected.

In this talk, Perl 5’s project manager will report on the year’s work, giving
demonstrations of the new features added to Perl 5.18 as well as the old
features marked for removal. We’ll look at features on the horizon for the next
year or two.

All these changes go through the perl5-porters mailing list, an exciting,
excited, sometimes dysfunctional collection of programmers and devotees, and
we’ll talk about how that group works or doesn’t work, and what we’re trying to
do to keep things awesome.

## Notes

I gave this talk at YAPC in Austin.  Austin was great, and I remember this talk
not at all.
