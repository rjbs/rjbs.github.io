## Notes

I gave this talk at the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop, and details of its agenda
have seemingly vanished from the web.  That stinks.

This was surely my first "perldelta" talk, where I ran through the new features
(and bugfixes and other stuff) in the year's new perl.  This lines up nicely
with the switch to an annual perl release schedule, which started with 5.12.0.

Doing perldelta explanations was part of how I got into perl5-porters at all.
I'd been writing up long emails to my local Perl Mongers group about v5.10.0,
which led me to going back to perl5-porters to ask about things that didn't
make sense.  Some were fixed, some were removed, and I stuck around.

These days, I would've picked a different talk title.
