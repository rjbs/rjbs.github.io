## Abstract

This year’s release is not bursting with new features, but we’ll tell you what
they are and why they’re great. More than that, though, we’ll talk about what’s
going on in Perl development, and what to expect from the coming year.

## Notes

This was my first public perldelta talk in five years, and we didn't have all
that much technical change to discuss.  The big deal was the crisis in the
governance of the project.  I should write more about that sometime, or maybe
just make sure my big ["what the hell is going
on"](https://lwn.net/Articles/828384/) post of 2020 doesn't fall off the
internet.  For now, though, I wrote blather on here.
