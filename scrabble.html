		Everyone probably knows what Scrabble is, but I'll explain it anyway.  It's
		a board game.  The board consists of a 15 by 15 grid of squares and there
		are 100 playing pieces marked with a letter of the alphabet and a point
		value.  Players use their pieces to spell out words on the grid, always
		intersecting with previously played words.  Many squares have value
		modifiers that alter the scoring of a word, but, generally, each word is
		scored by the modified sum of its letters' points.

	<p>
		I enjoy Scrabble.  It's not that I have a lot of fun playing Scrabble,
		because Scrabble isn't really fun.  My enjoyment doesn't come from any sort
		of sense of superiority, either:  I'm not very good at Scrabble.  The
		simple fact may be that I enjoy it because it's an interesting and somewhat
		pointless endeavor.  These seem to catch my interest.  My belief, though,
		is that Scrabble is interesting mostly because it forces one to think about
		words in a way completely contrary to the normal way.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Normally, we think about words in three ways:  Definitionally,
		representatively, and phonetically.  For example, we might wonder or ask:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    "What words mean <span class='def'>the plot of ground about a sundial</span>?"<br />
	
		That's definitional.  We're looking for a word based on its meaning, and if
		we're lucky, we can think of the word we want:  <span
		class='def'>wabe</span>.  We do this all the time when talking. Usually,
		it's not quite volitional:  we have a meaning to express and we do so
		effortlessly through language, picking out the right words as we go.  When
		we ask definitional questions, we're phrasing them in terms of other
		definitions, which in turn recurse to further definitions.  To answer the
		question above, we must first know <span class='def'>plot</span>, <span
		class='def'>ground</span>, <span class='def'>sundial</span>, and the
		articles and pronouns.  Eventually, these questions become representative.
	  </li>
	
	  <li>
	    "What is the word for the object of which I am thinking?"<br />
	
		That's a representative question.  It's a lot like a definitional question,
		but the profound difference is that we phrase it in terms of a concept, and
		not a word.  This is an interesting phenomenon, especially considering the
		fact that some hermeneutical philosophers (like Gadamer) believe that all
		thought and experience is <em>worded</em>, meaning that it occurs through
		language.  Still, there are moments of confusion when one can see an object
		in one's mind eye and find no way to name or describe it.  It is worth
		noting that being able to describe an object in words but not name it is a
		definitional problem, but that merely <em>conceiving</em> of an object (or
		quality, relationship, or action) without finding words to describe it is a
		representative problem.
	  </li>
	
	  <li>
		"What's a word that starts with the letter <span class='def'>Q</span> and
		rhymes with spinach?"<br />
	
		That's a phonetic question.  Here, we don't care what the word means or
		represents.  We only care how it sounds.  It's interesting to note, here,
		that we often answer these questions by listing sounds that match and then
		asking ourselves if they are words at all.  This may be the closest normal
		method of word-handling to Scrabble.
	  </li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		These queries can be stacked, too.  Writing poetry, we might look for a
		word meaning <span class='def'>love</span> that rhymes with <span
		class='def'>esophagus</span>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Scrabble, though, asks us to find words anagrammatically.  That is, we are
		given a set of letters (not, it is important to note, sounds) and asked to
		come up with a word.  Further, I would describe Scrabble's question as
		<span class='def'>weighted</span> and <span class='def'>restricted</span>.
		It is <dfn>weighted</dfn> because one is rewarded disproportionately for
		using certain letters and positions.  It is <dfn>restricted</dfn> because
		every possible answer is not allowed.  The player must build from an
		existing word and may not intersect other words when the intersection will
		create gibberish.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Anagrams, words formed by rearranging the letters of other words, have been
		around for a long time.  They're still a popular word game, and it's
		interesting that Scrabble calls itself a "crossword game" and not an
		"anagram game."  Crosswords pose definitional questions, and Scrabble does
		not quibble over meaning.  I believe it's because many more people enjoy
		crosswords than enjoy anagrams, despite the fact that anagram games ("Word
		Scrambles") still appear in most daily newspapers and game books.  Why
		should one form of word question be more popular than another?
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Meanings of words (especially <span class='def'>roots</span>) are often
		nearly arbitrary on the surface:  why is a cat called a cat?  Partly
		because of this, we must ask representative questions.  These provide a
		direct route from perceive object to representing word.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Other words are composite, and can be decompiled into root words to find a
		pointer to meaning.  For example <span class='def'>asynchronous</span> is a
		composition of <span class='def'>a</span> (not), <span
		class='def'>syn</span> (together with), and <span
		class='def'>chronos</span> (time).  It means: <span class='def'>not at the
		same time</span>.  Words like these are excellent for asking and answering
		definitional questions, because a properly constructed compound word can
		answer its own definitional question.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Finally, the sounds of spoken words are compiled from the words' component
		letters, and a heard word can be decompiled from sound into letters.
		Although the phonetic (sound to spelling) relationship is not one-to-one in
		most phonetic languages, it is not arbitrary.  With relatively few
		exceptions, a literate person can pronounce any written word and write any
		pronounced word with a fair degree of accuracy, answering phonetic
		questions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		While those three types of query are specific to words, anagrammatic
		rearrangement can be applied to any sequence of items, even if the sequence
		is meaningless.  As the letters of a word may be reorganized, so may be the
		digits of a number, the words of a sentence, or notes of a musical
		composition.  Anagrams of words are especially interesting, though, because
		the meanings of created words are almost completely unrelated to their
		component letters, and the sounds of created words are only marginally more
		related.  Further, while <span class='def'>veftacrol</span> is an anagram
		of <span class='def'>Lovecraft</span>, <span class='def'>volt farce</span>
		seems preferable because it has meaning.  <span class='def'>Volt
		farce</span> answers the anagrammatic question, but why is the question
		asked?  Only for word games.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		That suggests, to me, that because Scrabble is based on a skill of no
		immediate use, it is either a purely intellectual exercise with no
		practical analogue, or it is, itself, the analogue of another form of
		practical intellectual activity that I cannot name.  I am tempted to
		believe the latter, but for no other reason than this:  I like Scrabble.  I
		want it to mean something.
