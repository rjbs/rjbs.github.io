## Hello, world!

My name is Ricardo Signes.  I live in Philadelphia.  I do lots of normal human
things, including sometimes writing computer software.

I made my first home page back when <acronym title="HyperText Markup
Language">HTML</acronym> 1.1 was just coming out and some guy named Mozilla was
releasing Netscape, which he said would replace the <acronym title="National
Center for Supercomputing Applications">NCSA</acronym> Mosaic browser.  I'll
let you in on a little secret:  I didn't believe for a minute that <acronym
title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> would replace such
tried-and-true services as Archie, Veronica, and (my favorite) Gopher.

Sure, I was wrong, but I've never admitted it enough to really dive into
producing amazing web content.  I just write articles once in a while.

## Contact me

If you know me, please be in touch.  I always like to hear from old friends.
If you don't know me, but have something interesting to say or ask, feel free
to contact me.  If you don't know me, and have nothing to say or have something
to sell, please don't bother me.  This is my personal contact info, *not
work*.  I will never, ever give my custom to merchants **or recruiters** who
solicit me directly via email or telephone.
