## Hello, world!

My name is Ricardo Signes.  I live in Philadelphia.  I do lots of normal human
things, including sometimes writing computer software.

I made my first home page back when <acronym title="HyperText Markup
Language">HTML</acronym> 1.0 was cutting edge and Netscape Navigator had just
hit the scene.  I didn't believe for a minute that <acronym title="HyperText
Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> would replace such tried-and-true services as
Archie, Veronica, and (my favorite) Gopher.

Sure, I was wrong, but I've never admitted it enough to really dive into
producing amazing web content.  I just write blog posts once in a while.

## Contact me

If you know me, please be in touch.  I always like to hear from old friends.
If you don't know me, but have something interesting to say or ask, feel free
to contact me.  If you don't know me, and have nothing to say or have something
to sell, please don't bother me.  This is my personal contact info, *not
work*.  I will never, ever give my custom to merchants **or recruiters** who
solicit me directly via email or telephone.
