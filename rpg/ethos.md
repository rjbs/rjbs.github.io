# Ethos

The Ethos campaign started when Complexity (a cyberpunk space pirates
campaign) ended.  Our first game was in January 2009.  It ended in 2014.

## System

We're played Dungeons & Dragons, 4th Edition.  Even though I occasionally gripe
and moan about this or that part of the game, I think it's fun and plan to
finish out the campaign using it.  I only laid down one or two [house
rules](#house-rules).

## Setting

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rjbs/5494445676/" title="&quot;Ethos&quot; - from Misthall to Teber"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/5015/5494445676_02a68c5a0b_c.jpg" width="800" height="505" alt="&quot;Ethos&quot; - from Misthall to Teber"/></a>

The World, several centuries after the withdrawal of Mankind to within the
walls of his great cities, the Poleis.  In Man's absence, the other great
races, too, have slowly begun to turn inward, keeping to their own homelands
and their own problems.  The age of Empires and Adventurers seems over.

The player characters are representatives of several of the unhuman races, sent
to Teber-on-the-Hill to meet with Mankind, who are now considering ending their
centuries-long isolation.
