Ricardo Signes spent four years studying philosophy and religion before
learning that jobs in those fields did not abound.  He managed to convert his
hobby into his profession, convincing his employer that it was a good idea to
pay him to create software in Perl.  Ricardo currently works at IC Group,
where he writes and maintains free and proprietary software.  In his free time,
he writes code to help making writing code easier.
