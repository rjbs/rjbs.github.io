	<h4>the black box</h4>
	<p>
		One of the best ideas in modular programming (and in much of design,
		really) is 'the black box.'  A <dfn>black box</dfn> is a mysterious
		device that accepts a given type of input and operates on it in such a
		way as to produce a desired result reliably.  Its workings are hidden
		from view, but because the relationship between its input and its
		output is known, its workings don't matter.
	</p>

	<p>
		A fast food drive-through is a good example of a black box system:  a
		customer provides input (an order, money) and receives predictable
		output (his order and a receipt).  We can make the dangerous
		assumption, for the moment, that the order always goes through
		correctly.  The customer doesn't know how the employees track the order
		internally or in what order they assemble his order.  He only knows
		that by giving specific input, he receives specific output.  Because
		the inner workings are hidden, the restaurant's manager is free to
		reorganize them to provide the same result <em>more efficiently</em>.
		The order-tracking system may be revised, the ketchup dispensers may be
		upgraded, or the entire staff may be replaced with robots.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's equally important that, because the drive-through restaurant
		interface is an open specification, others can implement their own
		drive-through restaurants, from which the customer can expect identical
		(although possibly faster or slower) service.  This means that if
		McDonald's is consistantly slow, the customer can go to Burger King
		instead.
	</p>

	<p>
		In terms of system programming, the black box allows us to specify
		purely abstract interfaces and leave implementation as an exercise to
		the reader.  If more than one implementation is forthcoming,
		programmers can pick the one they feel best meets their needs -- the
		fastest, the smallest, or otherwise.
