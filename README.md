# This is the source for my home page.

This repo has the documents that become [my home page](https://rjbs.cloud/).

It isn't very interesting.  Mostly, I took [Jekyll
Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), a quick-start kit for Jekyll
site building, and crammed in my content.  Then I fiddled around with
formatting and wrote a little paginator.

Honestly, you probably just want to go look at my blog, not this repo!
