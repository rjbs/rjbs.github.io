## richard iii

John came by and we all watched Richard III.  What a fine movie!

> Elizabeth: Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?  
> Glouster: Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

Gloria retired shortly after the movie, and John and I played some Typing of
the Dead and shot the breeze.  Good game for multiplayer.  It needs a better
keyboard, though.

## int-fiction

I've officially "filed my intent" to participate in IntroComp, XYZZYNews'
competition to write the beginning to an IF game.  I've got the framework
built, but I need to get to a certain point in the set-up before I can even
consider it kinda ready.

It's kind of a rip-off of my first abortive attempt at nanowrimo, but I think
it has more potential, since I can goof around a little more.

## work

Work is building up strangely, lately.  More large-scale systems are being
proposed and sketched, but I feel like getting them implemented is going to be
a very daunting task for just me.  I know I can conscript some of the other
employees to certain extents, but very few of them have any proficiency in the
languages that will be used to construct our new systems.

I need to convince the current engineering staff that Perl is The Right Thing
for them to use for their practical extraction and reporting.  I mean, look at
the bloody backronym!
