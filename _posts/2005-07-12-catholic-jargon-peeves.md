I meant to write this yesterday, and to write something more interesting today. Maybe I'll catch up tomorrow.

Here's another of my pet peeves:  It drives me nuts when people say "immaculate conception" when they mean "parthenogenesis."

Parthenogenesis is, more or less, spontaneous pregnancy without fertilization by a man.  It's what gets you a virgin birth.

The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception refers to the fact that the Virgin Mary was born without the stain of original sin.

If you want to reject the idea that either or both of these have ever occurred, that's fine.  Just please understand which is which and don't say things like, "Don't you see?  You don't have a father.  You were immaculately conceived!"

Even if you are a fictional character on a television show, you will sound ignorant, and some pedantic geek somewhere will complain about you on the internets.  Then how will you feel?  Not so good, I bet.
