I thought I'd look into how often I'd need various kinds of dice in D&D 4th
Edition.  I did this entirely unscientifically by grepping the PHB.

The d4 is used for damage of some small weapons, for pushing enemies with a
shield, and for the powers Flaming Sphere, Magic Missile, and On Pain of Death.
The d6, d8, and d10 are used for dozens of distinct attacks and powers.  The
d12 is used for three powers, three magic weapons, and one standard weapon (the
greataxe).  The d20 is used almost exclusively for skill checks, but those are
the core mechanic.  The percentile die seems entirely abandoned.

I could probably use some more d8.
