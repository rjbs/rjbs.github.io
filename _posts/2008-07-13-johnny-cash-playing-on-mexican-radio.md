I really liked "Mexican Radio," the one hit by one-hit wonder Wall of Voodoo.
I bought their album, Call of the West, in college, and I liked it, and that
was that.  I didn't know they'd been around before or after that album, and
hadn't really thought to look into it.

I should've, though.  I mean, did you know that Arrested Development, the hip
hop group that brought us Mr. Wendell and Tennessee are still producing new
music?  I didn't think so!

Anyway, it turns out that they did have other material, including an EP with a
cover of Cash's Ring of Fire.  I found out on Friday when Pandora decided to
play it for me.  Pandora has brought me lots of great music, but
[this](http://www.pandora.com/music/song/wall+of+voodoo/ring+of+fire) may be
the best track they've brought me so far.
