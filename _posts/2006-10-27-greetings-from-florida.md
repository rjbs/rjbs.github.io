Today was my first full day in Pensacola, visiting Gloria's parents.  There was a lot of sitting in the car and walking around an outlet mall.  I got approximately nothing done, which put me in a grumpy mood for most of the day.

I did get some new, cheap pants, and I ate some pretty good frog's legs. Tomorrow, I think we're staying in a bit more, so hopefully I'll get a little more done.
