I am not shy about using some amount of rude language in conversation when it's appropriate.  Heck, I swear about as much as anybody else on IRC (except sungo).

Despite this, as I sit on the bus on the way home, I wonder how many times the guy sitting behind me (and thus opposite two little kids) can say "fuck", "nigger", and "shit" in one phone call.  I also wish that I didn't feel so inhibited from asking him to tone it down.
