## rosemary's baby

So, I forgot to mention: I read Rosemary's Baby.  It was pretty lame.

I had seen the movie, and the movie was about as closely adapted from the book as I've ever seen done.  Obviously, this didn't make the book very interesting. I didn't get to find out all the interesting things that were quietly left out of the movie; nothing was.

I did learn, in the last few pages, that there's a sequel.  On one hand, it looks wretched.  On the other, I may read it anyway.  A full-grown antichrist strikes me as more interesting than a premie antichrist.  Also, it might be just as short!

## food

I didn't just eat the protein bar today, but I did only have a salad for lunch. Well, and a cup of soup.  I don't feel too bad about that.  Our lunch Zendo games have gotten a bit too long, and there are a few reasons.  I need to formulate (or find) rules that are simple but fun.  I think it's becoming clear that some of the (simple in theory) rules I've used have been hard for not entirely clear reasons.  Also, I think we need a time limit on turns. Occasionally it gets stupid.  Also, sometimes annoying.

I'm hoping we'll have more pyramids, soon.

## loafing

I thought I'd stay home and work on Games::Board tonight.  Instead, I played Sphinx.  I remain unimpressed.  More on that if $gamesite turns out to be not dead.
