I don't take the Goodreads "reading challenge" too seriously, but I did hit my
target last year, and it felt good.  I thought I'd try again this year and I
did get it done -- only just, though, as I finished my last *three* books in
the last two days of the year.  I think I would've liked to read a bit more
through the year, but sometimes I just wasn't feeling it.  So it goes!  I think
this is a "structure your time" problem, but also it's not the most pressing
thing on my agenda, you know?

So, here's what I read, not in order, and some brief notes.

## Greg Egan

Last year, I read *five* Greg Egan books.  This year, just two.  First, I read
[The Book of All Skies](https://www.gregegan.net/ALLSKIES/AllSkies.html), which
I enjoyed.  It's the story of a group of people investigating the frontiers of
their very weirdly-shaped world.  As with many Egan books, there's a lot of
very weird math and physics under the hood, but it wasn't critical to think too
hard about them, and I think that made the story more enjoyable for me.  In
this book, they would've gotten in the way.  That said, when I finished the
book I went and read a bunch of Egan's notes on the underlying ideas, which
were interesting (insofar as I understood them).

Later, I read [Schild's Ladder](https://www.gregegan.net/SCHILD/SCHILD.html),
which was roughly the opposite.  That is, it was one of the most physics-heavy
Egan books I've read.  More than once, I wanted to take photos of the page
because it was a wall of thick jargon.  I did not enjoy the book.  At the
beginning, I said, "Oh, this is going to be Egan's take on Cat's Cradle!"  That
would've been very interesting, especially because Egan and Vonnegut are so, so
different.  Or: maybe it *was* that, but I didn't care to think about the
comparison by the end.  It reminded me of Vinge, too, but not in a way that
excited me.  Anyway, look, I've read a lot of Egan, and I will read more.  This
just didn't hit home.

## Effectiveness

"Effectiveness" is my shelf (or label or tag or whatever they call it now) in
Goodreads for books on productivity and management.  I have a lot of books in
that queue, but I only make slow progress, for many reasons.

My favorite of the ones I read this year, by a long way, was [Radical
Candor](https://www.headhousebooks.com/book/9781250235374).  This is one of
those books that I'd read *about* many times.  It sounded not bad, but not
amazing.  But, of course, I'd only been seeing the shadows on the wall.  It was
great, and I hope I will go back to it in the future to try to puzzle out more
ways to do better at my job.  It really resonated with me, and I've brought it
up over and over when talking to other managers, this year.

I also read [Laziness Does Not
Exist](https://www.headhousebooks.com/book/9781982140113), which I didn't love.
It was okay.  I feel the author would probably just give me a knowing "don't
you hear yourself??" look, but I kept wanting to say, "Yes, don't work yourself
sick, but *honestly* you are going too far."  I think the issue is that an
indictment of a society-wide problem requires a massive-scaled critique.  But
"the Laziness Lie has you in its grip!", over and over, was too much for me.
(It was also funny that I finished this book just today, December 31st, and it
had text saying "Don't get worked up trying to meet your Goodreads goals"!)

Finally, as I wanted to get a bit more handle on some of my team's rituals, I
read [Liftoff: Start and Sustain Agile
Teams](https://www.headhousebooks.com/book/9781680501636).  I found it totally
unremarkable, so I have no remarks.

## Boss Fight Books

[Boos Fight Books](https://bossfightbooks.com/) publishes short books about
influential or otherwise important video games.  The books are written by
people who found the books to be important to them.

The first one I read was [Animal
Crossing](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/animal-crossing-by-kelsey) by
Kelsey Lewin.  I've played all the main Animal Crossing games and have enjoyed
them all.  (Well, no, the iOS one was awful.)  This book, at a pleasing 2⁸
pages, talked about the origin of the game, its weird launch history starting
with the Nintendo64 DD, how it changed over time, and how the author enjoyed it
(or didn't) over time.  I enjoyed the book, and felt like I'd read more like
this -- but it was also clear that a lot of the book was about the author's
life, which wasn't really what I wanted.  So, it wasn't a bad book, it just
wasn't exactly what I wanted.

[PaRappa the
Rapper](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/parappa-the-rapper-by-mike-sholars)
and [ZZT](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/zzt-by-anna-anthropy) books,
which were similarly a mix of "I am very interested!" and "I am not
particularly interested".  I knew what I was getting into, though, so I had no
complaint for the authors.  I just sort of wish there were more books about
these games, focused more exclusively on the history and technology behind
them.

I was surprised by how few of my peers remembered ZZT.  I remember it being
both impressive and influential.  I was *also* surprised to learn how
programmable its world builder was, *and* that ZZT (the game)'s author was
*that* Tim Sweeney.  (The book's author was [Anna
Anthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Anthropy), which was one of the
reasons I wanted to read this book.)

Finally, I read the book on
[Spelunky](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/spelunky-by-derek-yu).  I almost
didn't, but then I saw that the author was Derek Yu, also the primary creator
of Spelunky itself!  This book was by far closest to what I'd want from these
books, if I was in charge.  I got a copy for my nephews, too, who I introduced
to the game a few years ago.

## Stephen King

I read three Stephen King books this year, all story collections.  I've been
trying to catch up on reading all his story collections, and I'm very nearly
done, now.

First, [Four Past Midnight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Past_Midnight),
from 1990.  It contains four novellas, all of which I liked okay.  I read it in
part because I'd been doing some idle research into King's repeated setting of
Castle Rock, and saw that The Sun Dog (a story in this collection) was in some
ways tied up with Needful Things.

After that, I read [Hearts in
Atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_in_Atlantis).  This was a
frustrating experience, because I kept thinking that maybe I'd read it already,
twenty years ago, but I couldn't be sure.  This was *extra* frustrating because
it seemed to me like one of King's best books.  Structurally and textually, it
was excellent.  I would recommend this to somebody who wasn't sure they wanted
to read Stephen King.

Finally, [You Like It
Darker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Like_It_Darker).  This is a
collection of short stories published just last year.  It was good!  I enjoyed
just about all of it, *maybe* most especially the final three stories.  One of
these was a sequel to Cujo, which I definitely did not expect to be reading!

## Technical Books

This year, I've become the full-time lead of Fastmail's Cyrus team.  A big part
of my team's work is maintaining the open source [Cyrus
IMAP](https://www.cyrusimap.org/) server.  It's written in C.  My C is
miserable, and was probably at its best in 1992.  I need to get better.  I read
two C books this year: [Effective
C](https://nostarch.com/effective-c-2nd-edition) and [Understanding and Using C
Pointers](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-and-using/9781449344535/).
I think both were fine, but it's hard to say.  I'm not writing much C, day to
day, so probably some of what I learned has already faded away.  Still, I
thought they were both clear and explained a bunch of topics that I hadn't
understood or only barely understood.  Hard to judge, but definitely not bad.
I can imagine going back to them later, when doing real work.

I already read [tmux 3](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhtmux3/tmux-3/), a book
about [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).  I like tmux quite a lot, and
this isn't the first little book I've read about it.  It's hard for me to say
what I thought of it.  I think it was a bit of a mish-mash for me.  I was
coming to it with a pretty long history with tmux, so lots of things were old
hat and not worth my time.  But as with many complex tools, even among the
fundamentals there were lots of things I didn't know.  Here's my biggest praise
for the book:  After I read it, I went back to a few sections I'd flagged and
worked through my `.tmux.conf`, making improvements based on what the book
taught me.

## Slough House

Okay, so my biggest category of books was the [Slough House
series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slough_House_(novel_series)) by Mick
Herron.  A full third of the books I read this year were these books.

Here are the titles:

* Dead Lions
* Real Tigers
* Standing by the Wall
* Spook Street
* Nobody Walks
* London Rules
* Joe Country
* Slough House
* Bad Actors
* The Secret Hours
* Reconstruction
* Clown Town

Look, they're all very good.  That's why I read them!  The only notable
exception, I think, is Reconstruction.  It's fine.  It's just the least Slough
House-y book, really tied in only by one character, and structured very
differently from the rest.  I'd almost recommend skipping it.  It was a bit of
a bummer that it was the last one I read for months.  The last one I read,
Clown Town, was only released this year, and I read it roughly immediately.
(Thanks, Gloria, for giving me a surprise copy!)

## Other Fiction

I read [Thorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorns_(novel)) by Robert
Silverberg, which was a 1967 nominee for the Nebula and Hugo.  I can't remember
why I read it.  I *think* it got onto my reminders list ages ago, and then it
was on deep discount.  I would've done better to just not read it.  In 1967, it
may have been interesting, but it didn't age well.

I read [How Long 'til Black Future
Month?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_%27til_Black_Future_Month%3F) by
N.K. Jemisin, whose massively successful Broken Earth series I enjoyed a few
years ago.  This is a short story collection, and I'm a sucker for a good short
story collection.  And this was good.  I'm told that LeVar Burton read *two* of
these stories on his podcast [LeVar Burton
Reads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeVar_Burton_Reads), and I look forward to
listening to them.

A few years ago, I *finally* read A Fire Upon the Deep, by Vinge.  It was
excellent, with a sprawling scope, a complex *and* coherent setting, and a
whole mess of interesting ideas that all slotted together.  Mark Dominus told
me that the sequel, [A Deepness in the
Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky), was even better, but
"very lonesome".  I agree!  Vinge's ability to spin so many plates, each one
interesting on its own, and then to land them all into one neat pile was
impressive and satisfying.

I read [Ship Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_Breaker) and its
sequel, The Drowned Cities, by Paolo Bacigalupi.  They were okay, but I didn't
bother with the third book.  Bacigalupi's sci-fi work for adults is very good,
and I've re-read a bunch of it.  (I don't think I re-read Pump 6 in its
*entirety* this year, but I re-read a bunch of it.)  The Ship Breaker books are
young adult fiction, and all I could see on the page was all the depth and
nuance *missing* compared to his other work.  It probably would've been better
when I was twelve.  Given that it's a book for that audience, who am I to
complain?

I read [Dungeon Crawler
Carl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Crawler_Carl) because Bryan was
reading it and said it sounded fun.  It *was* fun, but I think too long for me.
Everything about it was just a bit *much*.  That could've been fun for two
short books or so, but it was the first book in a *seven* book series, with
books topping six hundred pages.  I tapped out, and will probably read a
summary some day.

Finally, I read [Virtual
Unrealities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Unrealities), a sci-fi story
collection by the great Alfred Bester.  I think I picked it up because I wanted
to read Fondly Farenheit, which was good.  I read it in the first week of
January, so it's been a while and I don't remember it terribly well.  My
recollection was that I thought it was okay, but on the whole not anywhere near
as good as The Demolished Man or The Stars My Destination.  That's the problem
with writing massive, incredible successes, I guess!

## Other Nonfiction

[The Society of the
Spectacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle) is the
longest 150 page book I've ever read.  According to Goodreads, I spent almost
nine years reading it.  It's a *lot*, but it's very good, and I think I will
re-read parts of it again, probably several times.  It's one of the key texts
of Situationism, a movement in post-WWII European socialism.  The book is made
up of 221 numbered paragraphs, which construct and explain the concept of "the
spectacle", a 20th (and, I'd say, 21st) conception of the problems of
capitalism and, to an extent, imagined solutions.  It's short, but each
paragraph deserves a good long think.  You can't just sit down and read the
book in an afternoon the way you could a 150 page book about Animal Crossing.

For a long time, I have wanted to read more detailed writing on the [Noble
Eightfold Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Eightfold_Path), so I
finally did.  I read [The Noble Eightfold Path: Way to the End of
Suffering](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html) by
Bhikku Bodhi.  I'm glad I did, but it's not easy to recommend generally.
First, you need to be interested in Buddhism in general.  Then, you need to
have read enough about it (I think) that you want to read what is almost a
technical manual about some of the core tenets.  It's a bit like reading a
catechism, in which serious religious, metaphysical, and practical questions
are answered in great and careful detail for the dedicated lay reader.  I wish
it had been a bit more focused on description and less on instruction.  That
is: I wanted to read analysis of and relationship between the eight practices,
rather than a book intended to convince me of their importance.  Still, this
got close and I'm glad I read it.

## What's next?

I have no idea!  Well, not much of an idea.  Goodreads reminds me that I'm
currently reading books about
[Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)), Rust,
and WebAssembly.  I received a few books for Christmas, and of course I already
have a huge backlog of owned and unread books.  There are just a few Egan
novels I haven't read yet.  Lots of books remain on my "effectiveness" shelf.
We'll see where the year takes me.

One thing is seeming increasingly likely, though.  I've read Gene Wolfe's [Book
of the New Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun) three (I
think) times, now.  These books get better as you re-read them and try to work
out the many mysteries within them.  Last time I read them, I thought, "When I
read these again, it will be with a notebook for taking notes."  I think this
is the year.  I might also finally listen to [ReReading
Wolfe](https://rereadingwolfe.podbean.com/) an epic-length podcast that
goes through the books chapter-by-chapter, just for people who are *re*-reading
the books, so spoilers a-plenty.  I've been thinking about trying to find old
hardback copies of the books to mark up, but it seems like most of them are
quite expensive!

At any rate, maybe in a year I'll write another blog post like this one.  If I
do, I hope it will be able to mention at least 36 books I've read in 2026.
