I had the week off from work.  Gloria and I stayed at home, ignored Musikfest as much as possible, and relaxed.  We saw a lot of movies, ate some good food, and avoided the downtown area.

I also consumed the first of my Safari books: Learning Python.  According to the author, I can now officially call myself a Python programmer.  I'll write more about my thoughts on Python later.  Basically, it has a few good points, but it also has some glaring problems.  I can't see any reason to not use Perl or Ruby.  My next Safari book may be The Ruby Way.

For now, it's bed time.  I have to get up for work tomorrow.
