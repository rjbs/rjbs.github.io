I haven't been to OSCON since 2005.  It kept getting less interesting without getting less expensive.  This year, though, [OSCON looks really good](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/grid) -- and I'm not just saying that because I'll be giving my Perl 5.10 talk.  There are a lot of talks, both Perl and otherwise, that look really interesting.  I'm glad to see that Perl is so well represented this year, with talks about new Perl systems that I know can really improve Perl software development.

I won't be there for the whole thing, but I'll be there for a few days, and I hope to walk away gorged with new ideas.
