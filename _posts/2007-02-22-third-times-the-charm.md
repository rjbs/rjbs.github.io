Today, I got my learner's permit (again).  It's the paperwork I need to have in order to be allowed to drive in the company of someone else, and I need it before I can apply for a driver's license.

This is the third time I've gotten a learner's permit.  I got one in the summer of 2000, while I was living in Boston.  I did only the tiniest bit of driving before we moved.  I called the Pennsylvania Department of Motor Vehicles and asked whether I'd be allowed to drive in the company of another driver while in PA, using my Massachusettes permit and, after at least an hour on hold, I was told that if I was pulled over for an offense, it would be up to the magistrate who heard my case to decide whether I was driving legally.

I decided not to risk it, and didn't get a new permit for a few more years.  I did a little driving in Steve R.'s truck and in our car, just in parking lots, and then I didn't get around to learning to drive, and my permit expired.

Now that we're going to have a baby around, it's going to be more often that one of us will want to stay home while the other runs an errand, and I think it's only fair that I be able to run the errands some time.  It would also be good if I was ready to drive Gloria to the hospital when the time comes!

So, it's time to get my ass in gear and figure out how to operate an automobile.  Hopefully years of Mario Kart will pay off.
