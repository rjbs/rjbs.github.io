A few years ago I heard about the game [Microscope](http://lamemage.com/) and
it sounded way cool.  In summary:  it is.

It is in some ways like a role-playing game, but in other ways it's something
else entirely.  When you play Microscope, you're not telling the story of a few
character, and you're not trying to solve a puzzle.  You're building a history
on a large scale.  It's meant for building stories on the scale of decades,
centuries, or millennia.

The game starts with a few things being decided up before play really begins:

* what's the general theme of the history being built?
* what things are out of bounds
* what things are explicitly allowed

From the start, play rotates.  It *is* a game, although it's a game without
victory conditions.  Each round of the game, each player makes one or two moves
from the short list of possible moves.  The possible moves, though, are all of
great importance to the final outcome.  Basically, each player may:

* declare the occurance of a player-described epoch anywhere within the timeline
* add a major event to an existing epoch
* invite the rest of the table to narrate a specific scene within the timeline

As with many other story-building games, once a fact is established, it cannot
be contradicted.  Since there's not really any challenge to getting your facts
onto the table, the game is entirely co-operative.  There is no fighting over
the story allowed.  Instead, there's a rule for suggesting "wait, before you
write that down, maybe it would be cooler if…"

I only managed to play Microscope once, but it went pretty well.  I think after
two or three more games, it would be great fun.

I had originally wanted to start a regular set of Microscope games.  Whoever
committed to each round would show up first for a game of Microscope,
establishing a setting.  At the end of the session, the players could pick a
point (or points) within the history where they'd like to play a traditional
RPG, and then we'd have three sessions of that.  It struck me as likely to be a
ton of fun, but I'm not sure I can really wrangle up players for it.  Here's
the pitch I wrote myself:

### Monthly Microscopy

Microscope is a game of fractal history building.  When you play Microscope,
you start with a big picture and you end with a complex history spanning
decades or centuries.  Microscope is a world-building game.

My plan is to play Microscope over and over, building new world, and then
running traditional tabletop games in those worlds.

Every month, we'll play a game of Microscope.  The big picture will be
determined before we play, so everyone who shows up will have at least some
idea what to expect.  (Knowing the big picture only gets you so far in
Microscope, though!)

At the end of the game, we'll have our setting described by a set of genre
boundaries and specific facts about the world.  We'll have to figure out, now,
what kind of RPG we want to play in that world.  When during the timeline does
it take place?  Who are the characters?  These are answered by bidding.

At the end of each session, each player in attendance gets five points.  If
it's your first game, you get twenty.  At the end of every Microscope game,
players can suggest scenarios for the month's RPG, and then bid on a winning
suggestion using their points.   Each player may bid as many of his or her
points across as many of the suggestions as he or she would like.  The bids are
made in secret, and all bid points are used up.

There will be three post-Microscope sessions each month.  They might form a
mini-campaign, or they might be three unrelated groups of characters, as
determined by the winner of the plot auction.

Each game will be scheduled at least a week in advance, but won't have a fixed
schedule.  Times and days will move around to be friendly to different time
zones and schedules.  Microscope games will be played with G+ Hangouts and
Docs.  RPG sessions will be played on Roll20 — but we might use Skype for voice
chat if their voice chat remains as problematic as it's been.
