I wrote a [todo for 2014]({% post_url 2014-01-07-todo-for-2014 %}), which I
probably stopped thinking about roughly two weeks after writing it.  Here's a
summary:

* write more prose and/or poetry:  **BARELY**
* write a Cocoa application: **FAIL**
* write more programs for fun:  **DUNNO**
* spend more time with friends:  **FAIL**
* get my driver's license: **FAIL**
* cook and bake more often: **FAIL**

Erk.

I perennially fail at these things, with rare exceptions.  I still think it's
worth making a short list, but maybe, then, I should be forced to re-read it
every week and write down what kind of progress I've made.

Here we go, I'll keep it brief:

* write more
* write some non-trivial programs in other languages
* get my driver's license
* read more (on Goodreads, I said I'd try to read 50 books in 2015)
* work through my enormous backlog of games in my Steam library
* get some home improvements done

That's it.  I will attempt to report progress regularly, at least to myself.
