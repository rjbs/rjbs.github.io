manxome.org is still in limbo.  I made another update to the NS records via gandi.net, to eliminate any need for the old ns names to resolve, thinking that maybe this was causing some weird problem.  Nope!  Hours later and I still get old NS records from tld?.ultradns.net.  I know it can take a day or so, but this is nuts.  Why are DNS updates still so slow?  I find it hard to believe that there are really good reasons for this nonsense to persist.  I just want to be able to get mail again!
