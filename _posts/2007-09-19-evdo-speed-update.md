Crome mentioned to me that my upload and download speeds seemed lousy, and it occurred to me that maybe the problem was that I'd hit a server that couldn't give me much more than 70 KB/s sustained upstream.  Today, I tried DSL Reports' speed test, not so much because I think it's super accurate, but because I knew it would be easy, and would be able to give me a better estimate than scping from a random host.

It tells me that I get 1144 Kbps down and 278 Kbps up, with a latency of 127 ms.  That puts it about on par with my DSL.
