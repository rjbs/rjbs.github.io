First off, I will not let the turkeys get me down.  When someone above me on the totem pole gets stressed over something political, I will not.  I will continue to work at the best pace I can, and I will not use my disgust as an excuse to slack off.  Furthermore, I will not be disgusted.  I will be filled with <a href='http://www.manxome.org/tao'>Tao</a>.

When the only option I see is an ugly hack, I will perform an ugly hack.  I will not wait until I learn more or keep waiting for help that is not forthcoming.  I can always fix things later, when I have knowledge and tuits.

I will keep talking about what I'm doing, because that gets people talking back to me about whether they like it or think it's dumb or think I'm screwing up a good idea.  This feedback makes me feel happy and productive.

A haiku:
<pre><code>	the same thousand lines
	a thousand times
	  twice
	this benchmark is pointless
</code></pre>
