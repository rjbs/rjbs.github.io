In general, I am a very, very happy cardholder.  Just recently, when my EVDO modem died, American Express paid for me to replace it with nearly no questions asked.  That saved me about $250, since the modem had just gone out of warranty.  That pays for over half my annual membership.  They also paid for some MacBook repairs earlier this year, which was a real plus.

Then again, I just got a letter that the "domestic companion airfare program" has been discontinued.  This was the program that said that when flying within the country, I could get a free ticket when purchasing one at their normal prices.  When going to YAPC in Chicago, this saved us about $400.  It's really the reason I decided to upgrade to a platinum card.

Now, instead of being able to travel for less, I have to hope for my electronics to fail to recoup the cost of membership.

It's annoying to lose such a great program, but... I still really like my American Express.
