I "run" the local Perl Mongers.  All that really means it that I'm responsible for sending out the "okay, remember: we're going to McGrady's next week!" email.

I'd like to find more local programmers and get them to come hang out.  I'm not a Perl fascist.  I'd be happy to have Python or .NET or Lisp or C or ALGOL hackers come enjoy a burger and have fun.  I thought I'd see if there were other groups, but no dice.  I googled for "programmer user group" and "programmer group" and "programmer social group" in my area, but no dice.  I didn't even find ABE.pm.

What do I want to search for, and what do I want to do to make ABE.pm more findable by locals who really want to talk shop?
