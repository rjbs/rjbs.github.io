Still exploring the museum under the statue of Cosativa, the troop poked around
the counter at the east end of the room, where they found an old green
backpack.  They catalogued its contents, argued a bit over who should take
what, shuffled gear around, and then moved on to inspect the featureless black
sphere floating over one of the display stands.  Watching it, Red was
transfixed and treated to a strange display proclaiming the broad scope of the
now-defunct empire and the meaninglessness of his life.  He kept it to himself.

In the middle of the room, the group found a detailed map of the museum, but
when Red attempted to copy it down, it vanished, replaced by an admonition to
buy one instead.  No sales personnel could be found.  Red declared that he
would commit the three-dimensional rotating blueprint to memory, no matter the
time cost.  While he did so, the rest of the group huddled within the light of
one torch and walked over to have a look at the brass doors at the north end of
the chamber.

As they approached, the doors opened and out clomped three robots, each
something like the centurion troopers, but larger and better armed.  Everybody
stood and stared — except for Red, who kept on concentrating on the map.  The
robots tried to issue orders, but couldn't manage anything but an
incomprehensible barking noise.  While the group tried to figure out what to
do, Rob-E circled around behind the bots, entered the room behind them, and
vanished behind the closing doors.

At this, two of the well-armed bots stormed off toward the southwest.  The
group cleared out of the way, and was unmolsted.  Unfortunately, the bots
passed close enough to the remaining dormant ooze to wake it, and a
free-for-all melee immediately ensued.  The ooze flowed upright and attacked
the robots, which fought back.  Group Leader commanded his troopers to join the
fight against the ooze, and several of the fleshy adventurers joined the fray.

Eventually, the ooze was reduced to a pool of fluid and the bots immediately
continued on their way down the ramp to level two.  The one that remained
behind went back to barking and gesturing at the party, and Yuki remarked in
irritation that clearly they were all on the same side, given what had just
happened.  It answered by firing a searing bolt at Yuki and setting his shield
ablaze.  The mercenaries sprang to Yuki's defense, along with the troopers.
Delian knocked the thing over and the rest of the group hacked and smashed at
it until it ceased to move.

Meanwhile, Rob-E waited for the doors on the elevator to re-open.  When they
did, he found himself outside a long room with a few tables in it, most of them
displaying complex metal objects ranging from cat- to rhino-sized.  He threw a
hunk of metal into the room, saw nothing happen, and commanded the elevator to
take him back where he'd come from.  He was worried that the robots might be
come chase him down and find him alone.

Upstairs, everyone piled onto the elevator to go exploring — except for Red and
two troopers who stayed to defend him while he continued to study the map.  The
elevator displayed a list of destinations to Rob-E:

1. The Welcome Area
2. The Map Room
3. The Labyrinth
4. The Halls of Victory and Defeat
5. The Shrines
6. Administration
7. Maintenance

The group decided to head all the way down to maintenance and see what they
could see.

They exited the elevator into a long empty room lined with shelves.  At the far
end, two small lights glowed on the wall: one red, one green.  The group spread
out through the room, looking for loot on the shelves.  As soon as they'd split
up, though, the far door opened and in floated a massive metal sphere set all
around by egg-shaped crystals.

As it moved into the room, twiting beams of light into multi-colored blasts,
the group took various strategies:  Yuki called for the mercenaries to surround
him while he fired crossbow bolts, Rob-E inched back into the elevator door,
pondering flight, and Delian led the troopers in a charge on the thing.

Delian and the troopers proved more or less unable to harm the sphere at all,
as did Yuki.  Group Leader was possessed and turned against the party.  Another
centurion was *slowed*.  Things looked bad.

Rob-E boarded the elevator and went to get Red.  By the time he returned, Yuki
was unconscious on the ground, nearly finished off by the sphere's light beams.
Centurion Delta's metal body was set aflame and burned to a cinder.  Red called
for everyone to get into the elevator to flee, while the sphere continued to
pick them off one by one.  Delian, who continued to fight, was thrown across
the room and vaporized by a beam of light.  Rob-E circled far around the sphere
to attack from the rear, but without effect.  He fled back to the elevator
along with the rest of the group, including Yuki, who was dragged along by
Centurion Beta.  While Yuki and Rob-E debated about their next port of call,
the sphere fired another blast of light into the elevator, disintegrating him.
The elevator, reflecting Rob-E's last wishes, began to head for the
Administration level.  Yuki ordered Beta to have it take them, instead, to the
entrance.

Back in the Welcome Area, the group decided they'd retrieve Centurion Alpha
from his entangled position in the plinth and then head out.  Eloise, Yuki, and
Exeter climbed, one by one, up the narrow shaft.  Exeter tied off a length of
rope to Alpha and Yuki and Eloise gave it a few good yanks.  The trooper was
pulled free of the silver webbing and crashed down to the Welcome Area below,
taking Exeter with him.  Exeter lived, but became entangled in the webbing,
had his left arm sliced off, and was knocked out.  Centurion Gamma tried to
free Alpha from the webbing, but he too was entangled and shortly ceased to
function.

With the rope leading back to the exit now in a heap at the bottom of the
shaft, Red decided that the best way to get out was to cast *Floating Disc*
long-from his spell book.  During the hour required, the group was interrupted
by a stumbling, panicked man emerging from the darkness carrying a glowing
stick.  They ignored him and watched as he tried to climb the sheer sides of
the shaft, desperate to escape.

Some minutes later, the elevator doors opened and the floating sphere emerged.
Red continued his ritual, with only twenty minutes left in its performance, but
Garth was having none of it: he shoved his way in, taking the rope from Red's
shoulder and casting it up to climb out, which he then did, followed by Red and
Michael, who hauled Exeter's unconscious body.

The unknown panicked man and the remaining centurions were left behind to
whatever fate might befall them, and the rope was hauled back out of the shaft.
