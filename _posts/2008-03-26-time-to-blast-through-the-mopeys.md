Lately, every time I'm done with work and have some time in which I could be getting things done, I find myself staring at my terminal doing nothing, or at least nothing productive.  I've barely gotten anything off of my to do list for a few weeks, especially a number of code-related things that I really wanted to have finished weeks or months ago.

I think I have become to willing to do nothing because I don't "feel like" doing anything.  Starting today, I am going to try to tell myself "tough crap" whenever I try telling myself, "I don't feel like working on that."

I'd really like to get some things done!
