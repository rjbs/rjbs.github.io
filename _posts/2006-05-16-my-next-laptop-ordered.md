[Previously]({% post_url 2006-04-13-my-next-laptop %}), I had wondered whether
I could cope if the new iBook replacement phased out the twelve-inch PowerBook.
I made a list of my requirements:

* small; no bigger than my first laptop
* runs a unix-like operating system
* Core Duo processor
* 1.5 GB of RAM
* second display at higher resolution

The new MacBook meets all those requirements.  It ships with a half-gig of
memory, but I'll probably upgrade it to two once I have it.  Apple's RAM prices
are usually insane, so I'll order from Crucial.  Oh, did I mention?  I ordered
one already.

I ordered the high-end white MacBook.  I put the black in my cart first, and
then decided I should double-check on the differences.  The black MacBook is
$200 more than the high-end white.  It has a 80 GB hard drive instead of a 60,
but is otherwise identical.  Well, and it's black.  The 20 GB hard drive
upgrade is a $50 option on the white.  That means that there's a $150 blackness
surcharge.  That is ridiculous.  I would rather use those $150 for something
useful, like the RAM, or new software, or a Nintendo Wii.  Anyway, everyone
else will be ordering the cool new black model, so I'll be the cool rebel with
the white one... right?
