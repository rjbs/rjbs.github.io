There are fourty-four seats on the bus I take to work.  There are ten people on the bus.  Despite this, like clockwork, That Guy sat in the seat in front of me, put his chair all the way back, and turned around to figure out what his seat-back hat hit.  Like clockwork, I moved to another row.

It is hard to imagine that he is not doing this on purpose, every day.
