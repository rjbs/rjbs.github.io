Today, Rafael Garcia-Suarez and the Perl 5 Porters released [perl
5.10](http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/).  This is totally fantastic.  Perl
5.10 contains a whole lot of great new features, from small but helpful changes
to error messages to new ways to scope variables and, well, all kinds of other
stuff.  I gave [a talk about 5.10's new
features](http://www.slideshare.net/rjbs/perl-510-for-people-who-arent-totally-insane/)
at PPW, and I look forward to getting to start using some of these features in
production code ASAP.

Which of my dists will require 5.10 first?  I have one in mind.
