On one hand, iTunes crashes all the time when I use it at home.  On the other, it is completely awesome for use as an iPod content manager.

I just have one little problem: it uses its default sort rules too often.  I have a few playlists that, when used together, make my life better.

Regular Music: genre is not X for qw(musical noise sfx ...)

Good Stuff: playlist is Regular Music, rating > 3

Four-Star Mix: playlist is Good Stuff, limit to 16 hours, choose by least recently played (yes, this gets five-star, too)

Three-Star Mix: playlist is Regular Music, Rating = 3, limit to 8 hours, choose by least recently played

Radio RJBS: playlist is Four-Star Mix OR playlist is Three-Star Mix

So, this makes Radio RJBS an awesome playlist for every day.  It's mostly music I rated 4-5 stars, with a lot of 3-star songs.  At the end of the day, everything I heard gets circulated out until I've cycled through everything.  I used to just have the 4-5 star music, but it wasn't enough and I was getting a little tired of it.  So, I added the three-star stuff and immediately noticed it was all NOTHING BUT TORI FREAKING AMOS.  I was going to castrate myself in a fit of man-hate.

Then I realized that there was so much three-star music, even after sorting by least-recently played, that it was going to a next level of sorting.  Since I can't specify that second level of sorting, it used its default: by artist, then by album.  I had to redefine the list to have a hard limit on last play: never played to completion, then limit to eight hours randomly.  For now, that's fine.  Eventually, I'm going to have to start futzing with the definition again.

I need a setting that says, "limit to X units by SORT, then randomize."  Still, Radio RJBS is a darn rocking station.  Now, if only I could mix in unrated songs and have the iPod glow blue when they were playing, so I could rate them...
