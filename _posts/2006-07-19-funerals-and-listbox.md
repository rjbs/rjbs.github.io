Last night, I dreamt that while walking around Philadelphia, Dieter and I kept seeing funerals.  A few of these were Orthodox Jewish funerals, and there was a lot of caution going on regarding handling the remains.  Later on in the day, Dieter suggested that we should go help out some of the many funeral parties, and he said that some nearby Methodist congregation was holding a funeral.  I decided that it sounded like a good idea, so we put on long black robes and trundled over to the church, where we saw similarly-robed congregants and a hearse.  We offerred to help, and were thanked and asked to wait.

Eventually, it became clear that we weren't going to be any help to the funeral party, but it turned out that the church was a Listbox customer and had some questions about their bill.  We found a bug in the billing code (similar to a real bug that I fixed in some PEP code yesterday), but were really eager to leave.  In fact, it was getting late and I needed to run to catch my bus.

Around that time, I woke up.

Moral of the story:  never try to help a Methodist.
