I've now logged just about exactly one hour of gameplay on Metroid Prime 3.  It looks really good.  I'm still getting used to the controls, so I won't comment on those.  The first thing that really bugged me, though, is the NPCs.  In the first few minutes, Samus docks her ship with a Galactic Federation warship and makes her way to the bridge.  On her way, she can talk to members of the crew. A few said, "Aren't you Samus Aran?  It's an honor to meet you."  Awesome. More of them, however, said things like, "I can't be bothered with you, I'm busy" or, "this job requires my full concentration."

If Samus freakin' Aran walks up to you, in full Varia Suit, and demands your attention, you give it to her.  Period.
