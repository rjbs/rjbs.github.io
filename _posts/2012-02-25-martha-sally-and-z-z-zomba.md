Today, in the back yard, Martha told me...

> I'm a zombie, but I don't eat brains.  My parents keep trying to feed me
> brains, but I don't eat them.  I eat people food.  I go the the grocery
> store and I say, "I want some cashews, can I buy some?" and they see
> that I'm a zombie and that I want people food and they say "of course!"
> Then, they don't even charge me any money, they give them to me for
> free!
> 
> When I get home, my parents give me brains, but when they aren't
> looking, I put the brains in the trash.  Then I just munch on the
> cashews and they hear the munching and they think I'm munching on the
> brains.
> 
> My name is Zombie Zombie Zomba.  My parents gave me that name.  They
> aren't my real parents.  My real parents aren't zombies.  Their names
> are Andy and Aggie.  My zombie parents stole me from my real parents and
> ate my brains and I turned into a zombie, but I don't like brains.  My
> real parents named me Sally.
> 
> I ran away from my zombie parents and was looking for a new place to
> live and I saw your house, so I went in to look to see if more zombies
> lived there.  I saw people food in the fridge, so I knew people lived
> here.  I decided to make friends with you!
> 
> Look, I'm wearing your daughter Martha's clothing.  I met her and I
> asked whether I could wear her clothes and she said I could if it was
> okay with her mom.  So she asked her mom and her mom said "yes, as long
> as she promises to spill any brains on them."  Martha said, "Mom, she
> won't spill brains on my clothes because she doesn't even *eat* brains!"
> So now Martha and I are friends, even though I'm a zombie!
