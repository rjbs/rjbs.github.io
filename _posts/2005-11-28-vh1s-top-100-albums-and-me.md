In 2001, VH1 had a show on which they proclaimed what they thought were the best 100 rock'n'roll albums.  I agreed with some things and not with others, and I printed out the list to use as a checklist for album acquisition.  

While cleaning out my office, tonight, I found the checklist and transcribed it to a harder-to-lose format.

Some of the albums on my list, which nows includes only albums that I don't own, are albums that I once did own but somehow lost.  I won't say which; just assume that the albums whose absence from my collection most mortifies you are those which I once owned.
