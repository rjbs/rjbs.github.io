Through aldaily.com, I got [this
link](http://www.christianitytoday.com/books/features/rumorsofglory/070604.html)
and followed it, because I greatly admire the work of W. H. Auden.

This note really did surprise and impress me:

Everyone should read at least some Auden.  I particularly like "[The Fall of
Rome](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15546)."
