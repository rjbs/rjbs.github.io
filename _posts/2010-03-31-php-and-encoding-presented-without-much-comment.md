I spend a lot of time dealing with character encoding issues.  Getting them just right is important and sometimes tricky, but getting them wrong makes you look like an amateur.  This paragraph from [a blog post about PHP and encoding](http://schlueters.de/blog/archives/129-Mind-the-encodings!.html) made me smile.
