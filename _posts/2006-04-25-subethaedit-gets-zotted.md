I've been using a [SubEthaEdit from CodingMonkeys](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) since it was Hydra.  I basically can't deal with it as a full-time editor, but for things like brainstorming and some forms of pairing, it's totally fantastic.  I can /msg my coworkers about some upcoming software, and once it's clear that we'd rather be writing tests than talking about design, I can fire up SEE and paste around a URL.  Everybody drops into the file, and we write tests and comments and maybe even documentation until we're all tired of it, and we end up with a document that we can all work against to Get Things Done.

It's also been really useful at OSCON and YAPC for collaborating on transcribing talks or taking notes.  That's where I first saw it, I think: OSCON '03.  It's when I got my first OS X machine, so I was high on Rendezvous software like iChat and Hydra.

Anyway, now they're working on a promotion with "[BLOGZOT 2.0 on MacZOT.com](http://maczot.com/)", whereby they turn blog posts into free licenses.  They're going to award $105k in Mac software through their "post about us" promotion.  It's a pretty weird promotion scheme, and I'm not entirely sure I understand it yet.  I do know, though, that SEE is a really darn useful tool and that last time they did this I got a free copy of AppZapper, which is also a nice little program to have in my /Applications folder.  Here's hoping I end up with a zero-cost copy for all my uses...
