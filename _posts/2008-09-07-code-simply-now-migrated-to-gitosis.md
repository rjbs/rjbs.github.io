For a few days now I've felt really unproductive, but also unenthused about any of the work I had in front of me.  Today, I managed to get one thing done, though: I reconfigured Code Simply's git setup to use gitosis.

Among other things, it means I can hand out the equivalent of "commit bits" to projects at git.codesimply.com without handing out system users.  Now other people can be productive for me!
