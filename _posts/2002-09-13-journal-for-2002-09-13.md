<h4>friday the 13th</h4>Not much to report, today.  Work was fruitless and boring, today, and there were pastries for breakfast.  I ate too much, and I should've stuck to my normal diet of cereal and ramen.  

Not much progress in Animal Crossing, although I've got some nicer furniture (IMHO) and paid off a bit more of my current loan.  I've got more new animals. (The last two were Freya (a wolf?) and Twirp (a bird of some kind.))

Our friend Joe, from NYC, is in town for the weekend, and we just finished playing some MB2.

I had an annoying experience at Barnes and Nobles, which I'll endeavor to record tomorrow.
