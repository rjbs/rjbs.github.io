Ruben Navarrete, Junior, is a syndicated columnist who frequently writes about
the problems of Hispanics in America.  I often agree with him, either entirely
or to a limited extent.  Sometimes I think he's nuts.  Today, I'm pretty
disgusted.

In his [latest
column](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/24/navarrette/index.html?eref=rss_topstories)
syndicated through CNN, he complains that people feel too free to use the word
"wetback."  Apparently Bill O'Reilly said it and then was condemned by a bunch
of people who said, "I can't believe Bill O'Reilly called Mexicans 'wetbacks.'"

Navarrete is upset because they should have said "I can't believe Bill O'Reilly
called Mexicans *the w-word*."  In other words, he's saying that "wetback" is
so offensive that it shouldn't even be spoken aloud, even when the speaker is
speaking about the word, and not about the people whom it is used to deride.
The parallel he draws is between "wetback" and "nigger," saying that none of
these people would have dared say, "I can't believe Bill O'Reilly called blacks
'niggers!'"

This is exactly the wrong position.  Nobody is going to forget that the word
"nigger" exists because we only reference it obliquely.  It will go away as a
term of hatred when people stop using it that way, and it seems absurd to
suggest that referring to the word "wetback" (as a term that one *shouldn't*
use to describe Mexicans, no less) is a gateway to using the word to refer to
them.

The only thing this kind of thinking accomplishes is to shift the emphasis from
wrong *thinking* to wrong *speech*.  As more and more words become entirely
taboo, it will become safer and safer to say nothing against those who use hate
speech hatefully than to take a stand.

He writes:

In other words, a real progressive believes that condemning hateful speech by
referencing it is, itself, a continuation of the original speech.

He's right, at least, to say that none of these people would have been likely
to decry the use of other slurs without some euphemism.  *That* is their
failing.
