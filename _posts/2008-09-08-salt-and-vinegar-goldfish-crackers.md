Wow.  I was looking at Wikipedia's article on [Goldfish
crackers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish_crackers) recently (don't ask)
and I saw an amazing fact.  In "some regions of Canada" one can acquire salt
and vinegar goldfish crackers.

I must try these!  Are they delicious?  Can you get me some?  Help!
