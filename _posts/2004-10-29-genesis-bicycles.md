As I believe the kids say, "Mad props due."

I took my bike in for service a few weeks ago, as the headshok had gotten rusty.  They sent it in for a rebuild and warned me that it would be expensive, but I knew it would be no more than a new shock.  So, I was assuming it would be about $500.

Today, they called to tell me that it's ready, and it is going to be just under $175!  I am a happy guy!
