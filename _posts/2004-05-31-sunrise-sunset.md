I forgot how long the days can be, here!  Morning twilight begins at 0415 and evening twilight ends at 2205.  In Bethlehem it's 0500 to 2100.  I was sitting outside waiting for Godfrey last night, and it was still bright enough to read comfortably.  This morning I woke up and saw that it was nearly full daylight. Scrambling to read the clock, I found it was 0500.  (I did manage to get back to sleep, thankfully.)

Being in an empty office makes the well-lit middle seem really long, too.  Yay.
