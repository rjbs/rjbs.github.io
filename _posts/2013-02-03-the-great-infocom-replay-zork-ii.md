In my memory, before I "came back" to adventure games in the mid-nineties, Zork
Ⅰ was an important classic and Zork Ⅲ was the serious, thoughtful capstone to
the trilogy.  Zork Ⅱ was, in my mind, an afterthought.  It was something I had
to get through before I could get to the trilogy's endgame.

Having played through Zork Ⅰ and Ⅱ in the last week, I can say that my
childhood view was dumb.

The first thing I found was that the map made much more sense.  I could keep
the whole thing, more or less, in my head.  Only a bit of the northern ledge
confused me reliably.  The Carousel Room made for a really useful hub, and
helped me keep things divided into memorable segments.  I found its puzzles
much clearer, except for the widely hated two: the Bank of Zork and the
Oddly-Angled Room.  Even the Bank of Zork didn't bother me so much, except for
the really lousy description of the Small Room.

The Wizard was much less annoying than the thief, but he still irritated me.
Actually, it wasn't that he irritated me, it was that his spells were more
trouble than I felt they should've been.  More than once, I thought I'd made it
through the duration of a spell, only to trip and fall, fatally.  Oops?  Still,
he didn't scatter the contents of the dungeon far and wide, and that's worth
something.  I liked that the wizard had more personality than the thief, and
the eventual interaction with the demon, who was also fun.  It made the whole
game feel a bit more story-oriented than Zork Ⅰ.

I enjoyed the robot, although every part of the robot puzzle was of the "you
will have to die to figure this out" variety.  The button puzzle, like the
button puzzle in Zork Ⅰ, was tedious, and to be solved much in the same way as
a maze.  Its pay-off was much more enjoyable, though.  I felt cleverer, and
making the Carousel Room behave normally was a real win.

One thing I never understood in Zork Ⅱ: what's up with the underground volcano?
What does that look like?  It's still pretty gonzo, and my brain rejects it.  I
know this is my problem and not the game's, and it's silly since I enjoy
old-school D&D, which is pretty rife with gonzo nonsense, but there it is.

Finally, I think the princess is a pretty underrated character in this game.
Who is she?  How long has she been stuck in that dragon's lair?  Where does she
go?  Who are her parents?  Why does the Wizard of Frobozz care about her?

I hope she gets her own game, someday.
