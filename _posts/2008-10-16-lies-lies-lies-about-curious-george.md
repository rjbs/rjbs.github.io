From Zap2It's "premise of 'Curious George'":

George is not a monkey.  He does not have a tail.  That, however, is a mistake made long ago by the original translator of Curious George.

The more appaling mistake is identifying The Man with Mr. Renkins.  Mister Renkins is The Man's neighbor at his country house.  He is a farmer, and is married to Mrs. Renkins.  There is no reason to believe, as far as I know, that there is any relationship between the Renkinses and The Man.

The recent movie version of Curious George assigned a name to The Man, but I will not repeat it here, as I find the very idea offensive, and do not wish for anyone else to be burdened by knowing what some moron thinks George's Friend's name is.

Time for Curious George.  He's going to make a lemonade stand and fix some traffic lights.
