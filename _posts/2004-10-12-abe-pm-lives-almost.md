Today was to be the first ABE.pm meeting in six months.  I got to Lehigh just a few minutes before seven, and at ten after, I was still alone.  I called Phil, who I knew was en route, and he said we probably shouldn't expect Jim or Steve. In other words, it was just Phil and I.

I like Phil, but I was really hoping for a meeting, not just a few beers with one friend.  I'm disappointed, and I'm starting to think that I should just give up and try to go to PHL.pm instead.

Still, Phil and I talked about a number of good things, including a lot of Perl stuff.  Mostly I ranted about how much I've enjoyed using Class::DBI and writing Querylet.

I also had some beer.  I had an Anchor Steam, which was as good as always, and then I decided to have a Delirium Tremens.  It was fantastic.  It was warm and somewhat spicy, like a slice of pumpkin pie.  I told Phil to try it, and he was pretty disgusted.  Still, I think I will be ordering one again, sometime.

Tonight, though, I'm going to bed.  I didn't quite finish HasVariant, but I think I might get it working tomorrow.  I'm pretty excited to have it finally working, after so much hemming and hawing about implementation strategies.
