"Wait!" you cry, "you must mean Horror Movie Month 2014!"

Well, I never wrote up our month of horror movies last year, and now that this
year is approaching, I better get it done, or we won't do it at all.  What I
should *really* do it harvest all my tweets about these movies from when we
watched them, but I'm not sure I can do that easily enough right now.

## Week 1

In the first week, we missed two days because I had other plans.  We'd make
those up at the end.

October 1 - (TPF symposium)  
October 2 - [Paranormal Activity 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal_Activity_4)  
October 3 - [Love Me Deadly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Me_Deadly)  
October 4 - [Dead End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_End_(2003_film))  
October 5 - (D&D game)  
October 6 - [Mulberry Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulberry_Street_(film))  
October 7 - [Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_(film))

Paranormal Activity 4 was junk.  Just let it die, people.  Love Me Deadly was a
pretty weird movie about a secret society of necrophiliacs.  I'm not sure it
was good, but it was strange and worth watching, I think.  At least for a
horror movie fan.

Dead End was pretty predictable, and generally not that good.  I liked it in a
strange way, though.  I think it could be re-made without a ton of changes and
be much, much better, and I think that's a sign that there's something good
going on in it.  Mulberry Street was something kind of like a zombie apocalypse
viewed from a small scale, just a block or two in Manhattan.  It was fine.  I
neither regret nor recommend it, although it had its moments.

Martin might have been the best movie we watched that month.  It's George
Romero, of Living Dead fame, and it was just really strange and interesting.
It's about a young man who believes he is a vampire.  I'm not sure we can say
whether he actually is.  It was good.  It wasn't quite a horror movie, but
that's okay.  I definitely recommend it.  Heck, I might watch it again
sometime.

## Week 2

 8 - [Terror Train](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_Train)  
 9 - [World War Z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z_(film))  
10 - [Let's Scare Jessica to Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Scare_Jessica_to_Death)  
11 - [State of Emergency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Emergency_(film))  / [Sea of Dust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Dust_(film)) (ABORT!!)  
12 - [Come Out and Play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_Out_and_Play_(film))  
13 - [The Ward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ward_(film))  
14 - American Horror Story: Coven

Terror Train was not very good, but was almost worth watching because it was
such a directionless mish-mash.  It had *David Copperfield* in it!  World War Z
was just terrible.  Not only was it a lousy movie on its own right, but it was
miserable as an adaptation of Max Brooks' much more interesting book.

Let's Scare Jessica to Death was interesting, too, but I'm not sure I remember
there being much of a point.  It definitely had a vibe that one doesn't see in
a lot of other movies, if any.

State of Emergency, like Mulberry Street, was about zombies on a small scale.
I liked it.  It reminded me of the original Night of the Living Dead, which was
obviously an inspiration.  It had a lot of little touches that I liked.  If you
like these kinds of movies, this is one to like.

We watched State of Emergency after aborting our attempt to watch Sea of Dust.
It was so awful that we just stopped.  It seemed like it was filmed by some
high school students who managed to get Tom Savini to hang out with them for
the weekend.  It was *really* bad.  We don't give up on movies very often, but
giving up on this was a no-brainer.

Come Out and Play was good, something like a Mexican Children of the Corn.  On
the other hand, it was *seriously* beset by "protagonist makes awful decisions"
syndrome.  Still, I liked it.

The Ward, as I recall, stank, despite a few good shots.

On October 14th, we took a break from horror movies to watch horror TV.  It was
the first episode of the third season of American Horror Story, and it was
okay.  I thought season three was better than season two and worse than season
one.  And I wasn't a huge fan of season one to begin with.

## Week 3

15 - [Kill Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Theory)  
16 - [Bitter Feast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitter_Feast)  
17 - [Macbeth](http://ntlive.nationaltheatre.org.uk/productions/ntlout4-macbeth), [Rise of the Reeker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man's_Land:_The_Rise_of_Reeker)  
18 - (DZ hacking)  
19 - (DZ hacking)  
20 - [The Hitcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitcher_(1986_film))  
21 - [Dark Shadows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Shadows_(film))  

Kill Theory had an interesting premise, but the execution (so to speak) was
lousy.

Bitter Feast, on the other hand, was sort of a goofy idea, but I enjoyed the
movie.  It was flawed in a bunch of ways, but the central conceit is "dude
snaps, goes nuts, captures and torments someone."  The dude who snapped was a
lot of fun to watch.

On the 17th, we went to Allentown Symphony Hall and watched a filmed
performance of Macbeth, with Kenneth Branagh and Alex Kingston.  We enjoyed it,
but it was just Macbeth.  Macbeth is Shakespeare, but it's not one of our
favorites.  We thought that would be all we watched, but it turned out that we
felt up to watching a movie afterward, so we watched Rise of the Reeker.  Ugh.

Then came [the weekend when David Golden and I fixed Dist::Zilla's handling of
encodings]({% post_url 2013-10-20-dist-zilla-v5-will-break-and-or-fix-your-code %}).  We declined to force
David to sit through horror movies with us, because we're good hosts.

The Hitcher was really formulaic and shouldn't have been very good, but for
some reason, it was.  Actually, I'm pretty sure I know the reason:  Rutger
Hauer.  For a bit more of a break, we watched Tim Burton's Dark Shadows.  Eh.

## Week 4

22 - [Critters 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critters_2:_The_Main_Course)  
23 - Hunter  
24 - [See No Evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_No_Evil_(1971_film))  
25 - [The Amityville Horror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amityville_Horror)  
26 - [Children of the Corn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_the_Corn_(1984_film))  
27 - [Zombie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombi_2)  
28 - [Laid to Rest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laid_to_Rest_(film))  

As far as I can tell, the Critters series is more like sci-fi than horror,
despite often being shelved with horror at Blockbuster when I was a kid.  It's
not a good series, but at least it's got a sense of humor.

I have absolutely no memory of what "Hunter" is or was, but it's on my list of things we watched.

See No Evil was really interesting, and maybe one of our favorites.  It stars
Mia Farrow as a young woman, recently blinded, who comes home and finds that
her whole family has been killed... but she doesn't find this out immediately,
and first spends quite a bit of time walking around the corpse-ridden house
wondering where everybody is.  It set up a good atmosphere.

The Amityville Horrorâ€¦ well, I'm glad that to have finally seen it, but it
wasn't good.  Children of the Corn, I'd seen, but Gloria hadn't.  This came up
when we watched Come Out and Play.  It was interesting to see it again, as I'd
forgotten quite a lot of it.  It's not a good movie, though.

I wasn't sure whether we'd ever watched Zombi 2, aka Zombie, but we hadn't.
Now we have.  That's all I have to say about that.

Laid to Rest, I'd heard, was bizarre enough to be worth watching.  I think I
agree.  It was sort of in the "creepy car following us" tradition, but not
quite.  It wasn't great, but I enjoyed it.  I'm generally in favor of movies
with unexplained weirdness (but not always: see David Lynch), and Laid to Rest
delivered that.

## Week 5-6

29 - [ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromeSkull:_Laid_to_Rest_2)  
30 - [The Innkeepers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innkeepers_(film))  
31 - [Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln:_Vampire_Hunter)  
 1 - [100 Bloody Acres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Bloody_Acres)  
 2 - (D&D game)  
 3 - [Maniac (1980)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(1980_film))  
 4 - [Maniac (2012)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(2012_film))  
 5 - [One Missed Call](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Missed_Call_(2008_film))

If Laid to Rest didn't have enough unexplained weirdness for you, the sequel
will.  I can only believe that the backstory added to it was done entirely
after the fact, because it has nearly nothing to do with the first movie, apart
from framing itâ€¦ but I was entertained by it.

The Innkeepers wasn't great, but it had a really good quirky tone to it.  If
the ending had held together with the rest of it, I think it could've been one
of the best things we saw.  Still, it was worth watching for the first half or
so, at least.

I tried reading Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter and found it too stupid to
finish.  The film was no better, although we did finish it.  Fortunately, this
isn't how Horror Movie Month ended, even though it was October 31.  See, we
didn't get our full 31 days in, so we had to go into overtime.

Next up, 100 Bloody Acres was a lot of fun.  A pair of hayseed brothers in
rural Australia discover that blood and bone fertilizer is even better when
made from humans, and begin a tidy little business.  It was fun and silly, but
still horrific and gruesome, which is a combination that we see much less than
we used to.

I don't remember Maniac very well.  I seem to recall thinking that it was
better than I expected it would be.  Also, weird.  The 2012 remake, starring
Elijah Wood and filmed in the first person, was, as I recall, also strange.

One Missed Call wasn't very good, but it was somewhat more coherent than many
Japanese horror movies or their American remakes.  What I really would like to
see is a sequel â€” and there is one, in Japanese.  I doubt I'll be getting it
onto the 2014 schedule, though.  More on that, another time.
