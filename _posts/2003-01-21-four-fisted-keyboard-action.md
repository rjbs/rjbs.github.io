I had a friend over today -- another skilled typist -- and we played some TOTD.  It was really fun, and I think that 2P TOTD could be a good party game, especially with some tournament rules.  (Were I to expect a TOTD2, which I don't, I'd expect tourney rules.)

The problems with 2P TOTD are really clear, though.  The Sega keyboard is just not well-designed for rapid, accurate typing.  While I'm sure it's fine for playing PSO or logging into your Chu Chu Rocket server, it's not good for real typing.  In a typing game, I want all the advantages I can get.  I'm used to the IBM m101, the One True Keyboard.  Using a SDC keyboard is like... well, like something unpleasant.  True TOTD enthusiasts must have the SDC-PS2 (that's PS/2 DIN keyboard, not Sony PS2!) adapter.  I'd love to get one before phun and Bryan show up this weekend, but it ain't gonna happen.

Also, while the two-line approach works well to indicate your progress through a phrase, the three-line approach for indicating your progress  /and your partner's/ is not so hot.  It was distracting, and I lost huge amounts of performance due to that confusion.  

I think that TOTD has huge possibilities.  If I was Sega, I'd be all about a sequel.
