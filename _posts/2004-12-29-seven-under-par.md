Like I said earlier, I've been playing a lot of Mario Golf this week.  Mostly I was focusing on unlocking the "star characters."  When you get the star version of a character, you can play him with slightly different stats and a wildly improved swing.  Yoshi, for example, went from driving around 205 yards to driving around 250.  Wow!

I was just trying to unlock Star Wario, because Wario is the man.  In an extremely close match, I did so, and promptly headed back into Shifting Sands, the tournament that has routinely kicked my butt and left me throwing my controller.  Although I had to do quite a bit of mulliganing, I beat it handily, finishing an amazing seven strokes below par.  The next best score was par.  Wow!

I'm not sure if I'll want to brave the new course tomorrow.  I might actually try to write some Rubric code.  hide mentioned it in his use.perl journal, and Andy was poking around with it today, and I'm feeling pretty positive about getting some progress made.

For now, though, I'm going to try to sleep soundly through the night.
