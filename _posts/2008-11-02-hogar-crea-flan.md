There is a fairly well-respected charity that's fairly active in Bethlehem.
It's called [Hogar Crea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogares_Crea).  I'm sure
they do lots of good stuff and help people.  That's the impression I've gotten
from various people.  That's not what matters to me.

What matters to me is that sometimes they come to my door and in exchange for
just a few dollars they give me a delicious flan.  God bless you, Hogar Crea.
