Andy Lester posted [his YAPC::NA
schedule](http://perlbuzz.com/2008/05/the-stuff-i-wanna-see-at-yapcna-2008.html),
so I thought I'd post my tentative plan.  I often change my mind at the last
minute, but:

## Monday:

*Skimmable Code*: Schwern talks about how to make code maintainable.
Maintainability is my watchword.

Either *Unicode for Silly Americans* or *Handling the Ball of Mud*.  I had
really been looking forward to the Unicode talk, but necessity forced me to
learn a lot of the material likely to be covered, these past few weeks.

*Email Hates the Living!* -- I'm pretty much required to attend this one.

*PAR + PDF + FUSE*.  I'm hoping to learn how to do stuff with FUSE, but even if
not, it just seems too weird to skip.

## Tuesday:

I feel obliged to see one of the other horror-title-themed talks, *Perl is
unDead*.

I'm certain to go see Dave Rolsky talk about *Fey*.  At work, we often make
offhanded comments about how Rolskyware is reliable, well-designed, and a good
default choice.  I'm hoping Fey will delight.

I'm also really looking forward to seeing Josh ben Jore talk about the *Perl 5
VM*.  He's definitely one of the people I'd want to hear talk about it, and
"Symphony of Horror" makes it obligatory.

Kevin Falcone's talk on timezones, *Why can't we all live in Greenwich?*, looks
like it could be useful -- although I'm doing a lot of learning on that right
now.  It also is the only talk that lets me not walk out mid-talk to deliver
one of my talks:  *The Joy of S'Ex*.

I'm not sure what I'll be doing the rest of the day, Tuesday, but I feel likely
to end up at Michael Peters' *Buildbot and Smolder* talk.

## Wednesday:

Well, I know I'll be at my talk, *Everything You Always Wanted to Know about
S'Ex (But Were Afraid to Ask)*.

I'll probably also get to Schwern's *What is Obvious?* talk, as it's a favorite
question of mine.

Apart from that, I'm not sure yet.  I'm hoping to have a lightning talk ready,
but I have plenty of slides to make before I start thinking about that.

I think this year's YAPC will be great (again!).  I'm looking forward to it.
