I finally got off my butt and took [photos of our
house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rjbs/sets/72157594373982223/) and put
them up on Flickr.

The photostream should start at the exterior and go through the second floor.
The third floor photos are earlier, because I took them when we were working up
there.

I should also scan the floorplan that was in our appraisal...
