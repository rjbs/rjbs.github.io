A while ago, I did a bit of work applying patches to MIME::Lite.  It's the most widely depended upon of the dists I maintain, and one of the oldest, with the most RT tickets.  I also don't really like it very much, so it doesn't get as much work as I'd like to give it.

Anyway, I recently applied a patch from one of those tickets, which was marked as being the patch that Debian used.  In the changelog, I put a snarky remark about Debian maintainers being jerks and not sending me (the upstream maintainer) their patch.

It was then pointed out to me that they had, in fact, sent me the patch, that it was in a ticket, and that I had marked it resolved.

So, hey, Debian guys who might be reading this and whom I didn't already apologize to:  I'm sorry.  What was I thinking?  Well, clearly I wasn't.

After giving people a hard time about giving people a hard time, I should really know better.  I will endeavor to be better about sticking to my own rule: don't be snarky.
