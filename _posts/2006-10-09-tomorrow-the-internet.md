My Covad install date for DSL is tomorrow.  I believe that at that point, I
will really have a connection that I can use.  It won't be conveniently placed
in my home, but I can deal with that myself.

In the meantime, I've been using the public library's wireless and my cell
phone.  The library is great.  It's quiet, there's power, the seating is
tolerable, and it's free.  It's also just a few blocks from home.  The only
real downside, apart from the "not in my home" aspect, is the filtering.  Their
"safe web proxy" system blocks bizarre things, including every single result
page from Google -- not the front page, or Gmail, or almost anything else --
just results.  I searched for "candy" and "Bethlehem" and both were blocked.

My cellular isn't blocked or filtered, and I can use it at home.  The downside
is far, far more obnoxious.  I get about 2K/s, and:

 102 packets transmitted, 101 packets received, 0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 756.064/1188.676/5232.009/639.804 ms
