Something Awful ran [an
article](http://www.somethingawful.com/index.php?a=3941) about the national
asset database and the things it should include.  This included things like the
Statue of Liberty, the Golden Gate Bridge (built with steel from Bethlehem),
and Wawa.  Specifically, "Wawa, Green Lake, PA."

See that picture they show?  Check it out.

Then check out [my picture of my
Wawa](http://rjbs.manxome.org/images/bethlehem/wawa.html).  Those scumbags want
the government to protect *the wrong Wawa*!  DHS is going to send people out to 
send their stormtroopers out to Green Lake and meanwhile terrorists will
destroy *my* Wawa!

I must quote the Wawa advertising: That's *my* Wawa!
