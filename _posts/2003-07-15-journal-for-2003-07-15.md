<h4>another day off</h4>I got a little later than yesterday, today.  Gloria gave me the Kirby GBA port. It's really good!  I'm surprised by how many transformations Kirby has.  It seems like more than he had in Kirby64, but that might just be because he had a small number of "base" transformations, and then the square of that number in combos.  Anyway, it's good.  I'm about halfway through my first run, which isn't a very good one.  Very low points, and I'm pretty sure I've missed some hard-to-find transformations.

I got treated to some tasty pizza today, which was a nice break from doing nothing.  A more productive break from doing nothing involved finding information on how to make the PPTP client in MacOS X connect without changing my default gateway and DNS.  Awesome!  Now I can finally connect to work's VPN without disrupting the rest of my life.

We went to the gym and I did more lifting.  My weight was up significantly at the end of the day!  I'm not sure whether to blame the pizza (boo!) or increased muscle mass (yay!).  I think the latter is likely only on long-term measurement, so I'm in the "boo!" camp at the moment.

I had trouble getting to sleep, so I came out and ripped my last two TMBG CDs. Tomorrow, I think I'll work on fixing jGal up a bit.
