After mumbling about doing so for ages, I finally bit the bullet and replaced
our aging and ailing car.  Our old 1997 Geo Prizm has been traded in for a 2006
Scion xB.  We drove down to Harleysville to [Fuzzy
Dice](http://www.fuzzydiceautos.com/) with Steve R., our consultant and
official Middle Aged Friend.  We did nearly no haggling because the asking
price was very close to KBB's suggested retail and we just wanted to get the
darn car and get home.

It took quite a while to get all the paperwork through, but I'm happy with how
the financing went, and the car is, of course, a lot nicer than our poor old
Geo was.  I accidentally left our old MP3 CDs in the Geo.  Oh well.  I'll ask
the dealer to send them up when he finds us a owner's manul.
