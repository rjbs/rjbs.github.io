It's been over six months since [my last bit of progress on The Great Infocom
Replay]({% post_url 2013-02-03-the-great-infocom-replay-zork-ii %}), but I have not given up.
In fact, I've put "make progress on the Replay" into my [daily
practice](http://tdp.me/person/rjbs), so maybe I'll keep making progress from
here on out.

As with the other Zork games, my enjoyment of Zork Ⅲ was affected by the fact
that I played it when I was young.  Quite a few of the puzzles stuck with me,
and it helped me work out an answer quickly in cases where I might have
remained stumped for too long.  I'm not sure whether I should read anything
into this, so I won't.

I liked the general feel of the game.  It was just a bit elegiac, but not
pretentiously so.  The prose is still (mostly) very spare, which is something I
want to try to improve in my next attempt to make a text game.  There's still
some good humor, too.  The writing is good.

I liked most of the puzzles, too.  Most especially, I liked that the game
subverts, several times, the idea that The Adventurer in Zork is a [murder
hobo](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Murderhobo).  Sure, you can kill and steal, but
you'll never become Dungeon Master if you do.  The game makes it pretty clear,
too, that you're a horrible person if you act like you did in Zork Ⅰ:

> The hooded figure, fatally wounded, slumps to the ground. It gazes up at you
> once, and you catch a brief glimpse of deep and sorrowful eyes. Before you can
> react, the figure vanishes in a cloud of fetid vapor.

I'm hoping that I'll find the Enchanter trilogy to be a good follow-up to the
Zork games, because I never played more than a few turns of those, and I'll be
forced to pay more attention to detail and give more thought to solving
puzzles.

Of the puzzles in Zork Ⅲ, I think that the Scenic View puzzle and the mirror
box may be my favorites.  They were interesting, unusual, and solving them made
me feel clever.  A few of the puzzles were no so great.  The cliff puzzle is
well known for being annoying: why would you think to just hang around in a
room for no reason?  You wouldn't.  The Royal Museum puzzle is just great, but
how are you supposed to tell that the gold machine moves?  Or why would `LOOK
UNDER SEAT` differ from `EXAMINE SEAT`?  It's these little details that remind
you that the Infocom games were still figuring out how to stump the user
without annoying the user.

The Dungeon Master was a good ending for the Zork trilogy.  I'm not sure
whether it's the best of the three games, but I think that they form a nice
set.  After feeling sort of let down by Deadline, Zork Ⅲ has me feeling
reinvigorated.  Next up: Starcross!
