I really like the Venture Brothers.  The show has only fifteen episodes, and I have a TiVo.  This should make it easy to see all of them.  Ha!

I'm pretty sure I haven't seen A Very Venture Christmas, but maybe I've just forgotten it.  Adult Swim never seems to air Past Tense or The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay.

I don't think we're expecting a Venture Brothers DVD until 2006 or something. I just want these episodes so I can tell TiVo to stop recording reruns.  Every week I end up cancelling or deleting one of the four episodes that Adult Swim keeps playing.  Are the other ones taboo or something?
