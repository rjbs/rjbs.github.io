I really wanted to do some new talks this year, but no really spectacular new
ideas seemed like good ones to promise.  I think "Email *Still* Hates the
Living!" will have to wait for next year.  Instead, I submitted a new talk on
[Rx](http://rjbs.manxome.org/rx), a talk on various new email libraries
released in the last year, and my long-threatened intro to git, "Git is Easy!"

Dieter submitted a talk about
[Dist::Zilla](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Dist-Zilla), and I'll be tickled if
it gets accepted -- I can go to it and ask hard questions.  Better, I can see
what questions other people have to ask.

I also pondered things like "I'll talk for 2.5 minutes about any 20 of my
modules picked by the audience" or "really random useful crap I wrote," but I
just didn't feel that I could be assured of quality without more proof of
concept work on my part.

This has been a really crazy busy week, so it wasn't the best week for thinking
of new talk proposals.

The first part of my huge giant application of
[Email::MIME::Kit](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Email-MIME-Kit) is now behind
me, so I'm hoping that next week I can really get to work on... well, the next
parts of it.  Still, it'll be nice to have that change of scenery.
