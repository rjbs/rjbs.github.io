I don't like to use the `/ignore` command.  First of all, I very rarely choose
to frequent an IRC channel with anyone I really can't stomach.  Also, as you
ignore more people, conversation begins to become incomprehensible, because
threads of conversation start and you can't tell why or who all is involved.

This came up today, and Matt Trout pointed me at `/shitlist`, which lets you
still see messages from people you've listed -- it's just that the content is
replaced with boilerplate.

Awesome.
