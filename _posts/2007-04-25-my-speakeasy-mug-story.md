A few years ago, I received a plain brown box in the mail. It came from my ISP,
Speakeasy, and contained a nice Speakeasy-branded mug. There was nothing else
in the box, and no explanation as to why I'd been sent the mug. I logged into
their IRC servers and asked about it. I found my logs of this conversation
today while looking for something else:

    [1805] <acestus> So, Speakeasy sent me a mug. WTF?
    [1805] <@das_runt-xXY> you don't like mugs?
    [1806] <acestus> I do, actually.  They give me somewhere to put my oatmeal.
    [1806] <acestus> but... I can find no info on why mugs were distributed!

    [1807] <@das_runt-xXY> isn't that enough?
