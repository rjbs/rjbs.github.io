This past weekend was the [DC-Baltimore Perl
Workshop](http://dcbpw.org/dcbpw2014/) in Silver Spring, Maryland, and I was in
attendance!  The venue was good, and the location was awesome, in downtown
Silver Spring.  Highlights, for me, included:

* getting to see my family between conference events
* Nick Patch's talk on [CLDR::Number](https://metacpan.org/pod/CLDR::Number)
* Philip Hood reintroducing me to [pentominoes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentominoes)
* catching up with Mo Chaudhry, whom I last saw in some southern airport
* lamb tartare for lunch
* really excellent roast chicken with fingerlings and kale

I gave the closing talk, and was happy with how it went, which was just a bit
of a surprise, give how significantly I rewrote it, repeatedly, from my
original plans.  I was also pleased to finally get a shirt with the way-cool
DCBPW logo on it:

Unfortunately, I vainly requested a large, which I've grown a bit out of again.
Getting into my cool eaglecrab shirt is just one more thing to motivate me to
get back down to 180.

I look forward to the next DC conference!
