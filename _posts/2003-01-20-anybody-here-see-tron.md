It's not that Rez plays like Tron.  It's not very light-bikey or disc-tossey. It's the pure, unadulterated visuals.  The wireframe is a serious piece of coolness, and Rez does not mess around with it.  It reminds you that polygons aren't just cool when used, /en masse/, to simulate curves.  They are cool on their own, thank you very much.

Basically, in Rez, you play some sort of 31337 h4x0r trying to break into a corporate computer in the future, or some crap like that.  Who cares?  Not me.

When /I/ play Rez, I play a wireframe guy shooting wireframe weapons at wireframe enemies who then explode into wireframe debris.  Meanwhile, funky music is played, mixed to my pace and activity.  mdxi called Rez "120% pure gameplay."  He spoke the truth.

The only problem is that I can't zen out quite as much at Rez as I need to. The visuals are great, and the music is great, and the game is good.  I need to be able to detach my brain from my mind to play a game like Rez, but Rez ends up requiring just a little too much concentration.  Maybe it's because the reticle is too small.  Or maybe I should really get that trance vibrator peripheral and stick it in my pants.  I don't think I will, though.
