I am always baffled by the neverending stream of remarks of the form, "you
people are playing D&D wrong."  Here's one that particularly bugged me, today:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I think starting off a new player’s <a
    href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dnd?src=hash">#dnd</a> experience with
    character death is a poor way to introduce the game and it’s more likely at
    lvl 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone is free to their opinion. I feel that the high risk of char death
    at lvl 1 hurts our ability to bring in and keep new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dnd?src=hash">#dnd</a> players.

What SlyFlourish should be saying, here, is "hurts my ability to bring in and
keep new players *who care about the things I care about*."  Some players
*like* playing in a very fatal environment.  People play all kinds of games "on
hard" on purpose, even games they haven't mastered on easy.  And anyway, having
a lot of character death doesn't make D&D *harder*, it just makes it
*different*, because *you don't win in D&D.*  And anyway, if you want to have
victory conditions in D&D, that's cool, too.

It makes me crazy to think that people are being told, "you can't bring in or
maintain new players if you let beginner characters die often."  There are tons
of games that work this way, and succeed in growing.  I know: I have run some
of them.  Obviously, you have to know what your players expect, and what will
make them unhappy.  Part of this is asking, and part of this is establishing
expectations up front.  I make it clear that characters in my games die a lot,
and that this is not about player failure, but about the kind of game I run.
We still have fun.  I have also played in games where the game master has gone
out of their way to prevent character death when it seemed really justified,
because they felt it would make the player unhappy.  I still had fun.

I'm not a big fan of D&D 3E, but I thought its [Dungeon Master's Guide
II](http://www.amazon.com/Dungeon-Masters-Dungeons-Roleplaying-Supplement/dp/0786936878)
was great because it talked about how to establish and maintain a game based on
what the players want.  That's how you make a game succeed, after all: you
figure out what you all think will be fun, try it, and then iterate on that.
That's why "this is bad for players" makes me crazy.  It's bad for *some*
players.  Or "I don't know how to do this in a way that players will like,"
which is a totally okay thing to be true.  There's plenty of stuff I can't do,
even though players might like it, and so I avoid it, because it would be bad.

The whole thing reminds me of [an episode of Parks and
Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawnee_Rangers).  Ron "Mustache Guy"
Swanson and Leslie "Amy Poehler" Knope have competing scouting groups.
Leslie's group focuses on singing songs, baking cookies, and pillow fights.
Ron's group struggles to build shelter and find something to eat.  He tells his
scouts, "We have one activity planned: not getting killed." By the end of the
episode, all the scouts in Ron's group have defected to Leslie's, because they
don't think Ron's group is fun.  Leslie wins, Ron loses.

There is where a lesser show would end, but Parks and Rec is better than that.
Leslie takes out an ad in the paper, calling for the kinds of kids who *would*
like Ron's kind of camp.

> Are you tough as nails? Would you rather sleep on a bed of pine needles than
> a mattress? Do you find video games pointless and shopping malls stupid? Do
> you march to the beat of your own drummer? Did you make the drum yourself?
> If so, you just might have what it takes to be a Swanson. Pawnee's most
> hardcore outdoor club starts today. Boys and girls welcome.

Then, *some kids show up* and they are excited to become Swansons.  There is
more than one way to be a scout.

So, here is my advice:  ask your new or potential players what they want, or
tell them what to expect.  Or do both.  Don't give up on what you like just
because someone told you it was a niche style or that you'd be unable to retain
players.
