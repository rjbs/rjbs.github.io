I was writing up a big post about how I want to deal with skill checks from now
on, but I think I need to write it another time.  Instead, I will write about
old school saving throws.

I have never, ever liked the basic D&D saving throws.  They don't make sense.
Why is dragon breath its own save?  Why are some things saves versus totally
unrelated things?  (I seem to recall rules calling for saving versus wands for
needle traps, or versus petrify for falling damage.)  So, what about the 3E
saves of Fortitude, Reflex, and Will?  Well, I really, really respect the
attempt to rationalize things, but I'm not a huge fan of those categories.  For
one thing, I liked that magic was its own thing.  For another, I want to keep
using the original tables!  I just want to have some internal reasoning for why
I pick a given save to require.

I want to use saving throws a good bit more in the future, so I wanted to sort
this out soon.  Here's the mapping I'm going to use:

    B/X Says                  RJBS Says
    Death Ray or Poison   →   Death
    Magic Wands           →   Projectile
    Paralysis or Petrify  →   Distraction
    Dragon Breath         →   Assault
    Rods, Staves, Spells  →   Magic

This mapping makes me happy.
