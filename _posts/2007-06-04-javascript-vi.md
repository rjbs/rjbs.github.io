John Cappiello pointed me at this really pretty excellent vi-in-javascript
thinger that lets you use an extremely vi-like interface to edit a textarea.

Here's what gets me, though.  Look at the domain:

    http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/

I mean, you can name your host whatever you want, but it's either a big
coincidence or quite disingenuous:

    This editor is a copyrighted application.

    If you want to use this editor in your own site, simply buy a
    web or email hosting account at http://internetconnection.net/ or
    call us at 888-xxx-yyyy

and:

    /* no particular redistribution rights are granted;

       that means you do not have the right to use this on
       your own web site.

       this may change in the future.

Bah.
