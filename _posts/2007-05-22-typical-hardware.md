Even hardware has heisenbugs!

My LCD was not working: it would just go to sleep when connected to my MacBook.
Gloria's iBook would use it (albiet over VGA, not DVI) and I could use machines
at work, both analog-over-DVI and digital-over-DVI.  I brought home alternate
cables, and it still failed.

The other problem is that I've been unable to get s-video or composite video
out of my MacBook.

With these problems, I spoke to warranty service on the LCD and the laptop, and
both were going to be happy to take care of it.

When I got home, I tried a bunch more cable configurations, and nothing.  I
tried cycling its power, and nothing.  I unplugged it from the AC power for a
few seconds, and no-- wait!  It worked.  What??

In the process, too, I found that now I'm getting s-video out of the MacBook
again.

Tomorrow, I get to call both AmEx and HP and tell them that they can probably
forget about any required service.  While I'm very glad that things are working
again... it might have been nice to have nice new units!  Oh well, there's
quite a while left on the warranties.
