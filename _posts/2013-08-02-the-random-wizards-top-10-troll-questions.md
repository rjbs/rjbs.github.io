I've not usually a big fan of blog-propagated questionnaires, but this one
looked good, because it will force me to articulate a few of my thoughts on my
D&D game.  These are [Random Wizard's Top 10 Troll
Questions](http://randomwizard.blogspot.com/2013/07/top-ten-troll-questions-for-your-game.html).
I already posted answers to the [20 Quick Questions on
Rules](http://untimately.blogspot.com/2012/02/20-quick-questions-rules.html)
that he mentions, for my D&D game.  [My answers to the 20 Quick
Questions](https://github.com/rjbs/RPG-Beyond/blob/master/FAQ.mkdn) are in the
game's GitHub repo.

### 1. Race (Elf, Dwarf, Halfling) as a class?  Yes or no?

Yes.  I like the idea of matching classes up with monster manual entries.  I
have a Fighter class for now, but will probably break it up to Bandit and
Soldier, eventually, to match my game's monster manual.  So, I match elf or
dwarf up with the monster manual entry.  Goblins, in my manual, break down into
a number of very distinct groups.  If someone was to play a goblin, I'd make a
per-group class, or at least have rules for specialization within the goblin
class, the same way I customize clerics per-church.

### 2. Do demi-humans have souls?

The nature of the personal life force of a sentient creature is sort of
blurry in my game, but the rough answer is, "Yes, but some demi-humans have
different kinds of souls."  Elves are often unable to interact with the
technology of the ancient empire, for example, because it doesn't consider them
to be alive at all.

### 3. Ascending or descending armor class?

Descending.  I really like using THAC0, I find it very easy to do the math in
my head.  In fact, everyone I've played with does, once I get them to stop
reacting violently to "this stupid thing I hate from 2E" and see how simple the
rule is.

### 4. Demi-human level limits?

Probably, it hasn't come up.  In fact, human level limits, too.  I don't see
anybody PC breaking past level 12-14 in my game, ever.

### 5. Should Thief be a class?

Yes.  Actually, a few classes.  When I get around to it, I want to break Thief
into Assassin, Burglar, and Dungeoneer.  Or, the other way to put this is: I
*do* like the idea of classes for skill-based archetypes, but I think that
Thief, as written, is not a very good such class.  I'm not sure who it best
represents in the fiction?  With its d4 hit dice, it's neither the Grey Mouser
nor Conan, both of whom would otherwise be decent candidates.

### 6. Do characters get non-weapon skills?

Kinda.  I should really codify it.  Basically, I assume that characters are
good at the stuff related their archetype.  (This is part of why I like more
specialized classes than "Fighter.")  If the player wants to declare that his
or her character has an unusual skill for some reason, I'll allow it at least a
few times.

I don't like skill lists.

### 7. Are magic-users more powerful than fighters (and, if yes, what level do they take the lead)?

We're using pretty basic fighter and magic-user classes, most of the time.
Even the tweaks I'd like to make won't change the balance much I think.  So, at
low levels, the fighters are more powerful.  So far, we haven't seen any
magic-user survive long enough to overtake the fighters.

I've been slowly tweaking the rules to try to change the balance just a little.

### 8. Do you use alignment languages?

No.

I have [publicly stated my bafflement by alignment
languages](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/10032/whats-the-deal-with-alignment-languages)
before, and although I was glad to get a pretty clear answer as to why they
existed, I didn't think they were really justified.  When different cults have
secret languages, they're just secret languages.

### 9. XP for gold, or XP for objectives (thieves disarming traps, etc...)?

Yeah, sure, XP for all kinds of stuff.  Gold, monsters, traps, fast-talking,
whatever.  I [wrote about gold as
experience]({% post_url 2011-11-16-on-gold-as-experience %}) before.

### 10. Which is the best edition?

Heh.

Right now, I use the Moldvay Basic Set as the go-to reference, with plenty of
stuff from Cook's Expert Set.  I'd like to read Holmes, as I have read good
things, and it looks like at least I should steal some of its rules for stuff,
but I don't have a copy.  I stole some of the psionics rules from 2E, and 1E
has tons of tables and stuff to steal.  I'm hacking in something like Action
Points when I backport my 4E campaign to Basic.  They're all fun, but I think
Moldvay is a great framework from which to start hacking, and that's what I've
done.

### Bonus Question: Unified XP level tables or individual XP level tables for each class?

Individual tables.  I *really* like unified XP, in theory, because it can make multiclassing a lot simpler.  In practice, I've never really liked how it works.
