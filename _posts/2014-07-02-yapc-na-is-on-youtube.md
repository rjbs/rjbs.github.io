I went to YAPC::NA!  It was in Orlando, Florida, and I had a lovely time.  I'll write more about it later.  I wanted to say one thing as soon as possible, though, and I thought I'd say it in isolation from anything else, because I think it's a much more important thing than some may realize.

The immediate availability of [YAPC::NA's content as streamable
video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFy5jmj6_Fd2YMuOjsovaIh-)
is an **incredibly good thing**.

Many conferences have promised that talks would be available online, but in
almost every case, I assume that this is not going to happen.  It's been too
often that I find out that only a *few* talks will *actually* go up, or that
the only person with the video files has suddenly found a higher calling orâ€¦
whatever.  At YAPC::Asia, they established a great track record, but YAPC::NA
didn't have one, so I had no hope.

Then, as each talk started, they were *immediately* available, *live*.  Because
they were streaming live to YouTube, it meant that there was no question about
whether it would be uploaded later.  **It was being uploaded now!**

First of all, this meant that people who could not attend the conference could
view the material.  I view this as a good thing, but I don't even care about
selling that.  You can think about how amazingly great that is later, on your
own time.

What I found amazingly great is that the availability of recordings granted me
**immense freedom** at the conference.  There were two talks opposite one
another, both of which I wanted to see.  I could pick the one where I thought
the speaker might want a friendly face, or where I knew I'd be more likely to
have questions.  Another time, I got into a conversation with Karen Pauley
about Perl Foundation business just as a talk that I *really* wanted to see was
beginning.  I didn't even have to think about it:  I stayed in the hall and
finished my conversation, because I could watch the talk later.

The availability of the talks online later meant that I could spend much more
time engaged in face-to-face conversations that simply could not happen any
other time of the year.  It is my great hope that the stellar performance of
streaming this year sets a standard to which future conferences must adhere.

I feel like I must anticipate the objection that if all talks are streamed,
some talks will get no attendance.  I don't think it will really happen, and
further, I think that if this is the case, I would suggest that the free market
has spoken.

So, to recap:  publishing the videos from the conference, and establishing up
front the reliable expectation that it will really happen, is *amazingly
great*.  Thanks, YAPC::NA 2014!
