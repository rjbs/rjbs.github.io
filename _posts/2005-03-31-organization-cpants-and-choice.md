I've made some revisions to the paperwork I use to try to organize my day.  I figure other people might find it useful, although the chances of that are probably slim.  If you want nice simple todo/done forms, suitable for clipboards (full or half sized), they're in <a href='http://rjbs.manxome.org/hacks/misc/'>my hacks dump</a>.

I also made some revisions to my <a href='http://rjbs.manxome.org/hacks/perl/#cpants'>CPANTS/Querylet script</a>. It lets me figure out what modules for a given author (usually me) are imperfect in some manner of Kwalitee.

Today, I am trying to make every chunk of time fairly useful, so I will keep this short.  I will just add that "The Choice is Yours (revisited)" may be the best hip-hop track ever recorded.
