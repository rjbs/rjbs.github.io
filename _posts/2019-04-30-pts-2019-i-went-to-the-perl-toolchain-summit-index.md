Once again, it is spring in the northern hemisphere, and so time for the Perl
Toolchain Summit, aka the QA Hackathon.  I've made it to most of these, and
have usually found them to be productive and invigorating.  Everybody shows up
with something to do, most of the people you need to help you are there, and
everybody is interested in what everybody else is doing and will offer good
feedback, advice, or just expressions of appreciation (or sympathy, as the case
may require).

The most common topics for me at past summits have been PAUSE, CPAN Testers,
Dist::Zilla, and the CPAN::Meta specification.  This year, I focused almost
entirely on PAUSE, and I think it paid off.  Last year, I did quite a bit of
work on Dist::Zilla and wasn't happy with the end result.  It might have been a
good time to have a second go, but I decided I had a lot more support personnel
on hand for PAUSE, and stuck with it.  I'll try to give a general run-down of
what I worked on in my posts, and some of it I'll probably try to expand into
some reference material for future PAUSE contributors.

Here are my posts about the summit:
