Today, I hit the road with my Franklin CDU-680 from 3gstore.com.  As the bus left Bethlehem, I wasn't exactly thrilled.  Sure, I was online and staying online, but I was only getting about 80kbps, only about twice what I got on GPRS.  As we got to Quakertown, I started to quit apps, thinking I'd reboot for... well, because I was desperate.  Around then, though, ping times dropped from about 700ms to about 100ms, bandwidth increased tenfold, and things got to be what I wanted.  I stayed online all the way to Philly, with great speeds.

On the way home, I got online at high speed and stayed online at high speed until I got home.  Unless something really weird happens, it looks like I've found my EVDO device, and I couldn't be happier about it.
