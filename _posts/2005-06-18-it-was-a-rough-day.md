This morning, my bus broke down on the way to work, and I was over an hour late.  While there, I found out that some of my code, which had passed all its tests, was not working properly.  It turned out that in some code that said "print if testing, otherwise send mail," the thing I was printing or sending differed, because I had two variables with too-similar names.  My fries, at lunch, were insufficiently salted.  On the way out of the office, I realized that I lost my bus tickets -- in other words, about $30.  I'm pretty sure they fell out of my pocket at lunch.

Once home, things were much better.  Gloria made tasty spaghetti, we watched some TV, and I had some vermouth.  Still, I am looking forward to it being tomorrow.
