I have never been shy about stating my opinion on bards in Dungeons and
Dragons.  They suck.  They make no damn sense and I wish, just this once, we
could pretend that they never existed and drop them from the game.

If you don't know much about bards, here's the short version: bards can do a
little bit of everything, including casting spells.  They originated in
first-edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.  First edition is totally bizarre
and full of madness.  For example, there's the monk.  The PHB knows that the
monk is weird.  Here's what it has to say:

> The monk is the most unusual of all characters, the hardest to qualify for,
> and perhaps, the most deadly.  That is why the class is given out of
> alphabetical order at the end of the section pertaining to character
> classes.

It's true.  The first edition monk is *weird*.  Eventually, the monk got
evolved into something much better.  The third edition monk just makes sense
and fits.

D&D does this a lot.  First edition D&D introduced huge numbers of awful
concepts that became iconic, even though they were sort of ridiculous.
Something Awful has run a [fantastic series on stupid old D&D
book](http://www.somethingawful.com/d/dungeons-and-dragons/) that features a
lot of the dumb from first edition D&D.

What they don't do, though, is show how many first edition things were pretty
dumb, but got better later.  There's the monk, the beholder, the outer planes,
the barbarian, the rust monster...  D&D hates to abandon things that otherwise seem dumb.  Like, that rust monster?  They just ran [an article designed to make rust monsters make
sense](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dreo/2009June).

Remember how the monk was so weird that they put it last, instead of in
alphabetical order?  Well, the bard is so weird that they put it in Appendix
II.  What is a bard?  What makes it so weird?

What??

It just doesn't make sense.  What does this have to do with being a bard?
A bard is a poet, right?  Or something?

Well, bards have poetic skill, yes.  In first edition, it gives them the
ability to charm enemies and raise morale.  Okay, I can dig that.  They also
have some features related to knowing legends and lore.  That makes sense, too.
They can cast spells -- druid spells -- because they spent time as a druid.
They're just normal druid spells.

So, they have an assortment of skills learned by doing this and that.  They can
cast druid spells, and they have skills you'd expect from an itinerant poet.  I
don't really know what the point of having this super contrived class was, but
it kind of sort of makes a little sense.  (I assume that the point of having it
was to salvage the previously introduced bard class from The Strategic Review,
but I'm afraid I don't have a copy of that.)

Second edition is probably my least disliked incarnation of the bard.  It makes
the central idea of the bard, "jack of all trades."  They have a bunch of thief
skills, they can fight and wear armor, they've learned a bit of magic here and
there, and, oh, they can perform.  Their music or poetry is still used for
affecting morale, which still makes sense.  They're part of the rogue class
group, which totally works for me.  They're the kind of adventurer who drifts
into the village and claims to be whatever will get him the best accomodations.
Further, the Complete Bard's Handbook was printed.  I remember how reticent I
was to spent money on a Bard-related product, but it was pretty good, just like
most of the class splat books.  It listed a dozen or so kits to tweak just what
your bard was.

So, the bard got saved, just like the monk, right?  Well, no.  If the bard had continued on this line of development, I guess it would have been saved.  The third edition bard could've been a class I just didn't choose often but was fine, and then fourth edition bards would be
great.  Instead, third edition made this bizarre change that breaks my heart:

> A bard's magic comes from the heart.  If his heart is good, a bard brings
> hope and courage to the downtrodden and uses his tricks, muic, and magic to
> thwart the schemes of evildoers.

What?  Oh, and then:

> A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book.  He can only
> cast a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or
> preparing them in advance.

So, in 2E, a bard could cast magic because he learned a little magic, just like
he could pick pockets because he learned a little bit of theivery.  In 3E,
bards can just bust out magic because their singing is so awesome.  They've
gone from "jack of all trades" roguish wanderers into "performers so charismatic
that magic happens."  They can still use music to cheer their allies and cow
their enemies, but *now that is magic*.  This is all defined in their "Bardic
Music" power, which very clearly says that the bard's music creates magical
effects.  Without going too much into the details, a 4E bard is the 3E bard, adapted for
the new system.

So, a 2E bard, in combat, might cast a spell or two, might do some swordplay,
might sneak around in the shadows behind the enemy.  You never know what he's
going to do, because he can do it all.  On the other hand, you know just what a
4E bard is going to do.  He's going to *sing*.

This is where it all falls apart for me.  The wizard draws his wand and begins
to recite arcane invocations.  The fighter raises his sword and takes a
defensive stance.  The cleric kisses his holy symbol and calls on his god.  The
ranger nocks an arrow and takes aim.  Then, as the swarm of goblins closes in
on the party, the bard start to sing.

Later, there's a locked door and the rogue has been downed.  "Don't worry,"
says the bard, "I can *sing* it open!"  What can the rest of the party do but
look shamefacedly away and think, "We can't just kick him out for singing, can
we?  I mean, he does get results."

It's not fair to gripe about the flavor text for powers, since so many powers
have imperfect flavor text, but I'm going to anyway.  Here are two great
examples of "what do you mean, he *sings* magic?" from PHB2:

> Your attack resonates in an arcane song that allows an ally to teleport to
> your side.

and:

> With a sonorous hum, you summon lightning, blasting your foes with it and
> imbuing your alliesâ€™ attacks with its power.

I just don't buy it.  I cannot conceive of any party-based fantasy role-playing
setting where it makes sense to have "the guy who starts singing in the middle
of combat."  Oh, and maybe he plays the lute.  I like the idea that your
fighter might take History and Performance and be a bard in addition to being
an adventurer.  Maybe he can use Performance to get a Skill Power that lets him
raise morale.  That would be cool.

Too bad there isn't a Performance skill.

So, what are the alternatives?  Well, Dieter and I talked about rebranding the
4E bard class entirely as a "war wizard" kind of Arcane-powered Leader.  I
think that's possible.  I don't know if there's a lot of point in doing it, but
if a player wanted to do that, I'd definitely let him.

The problem with a 2E-style bard in 4E is that by definition it will not fit
into one power source or one role.  It's more than just a hybrid class, it's
the ultimate hybrid class.  Maybe that means it belongs in the back of the PHB3
in an appendix.  I think I'd be okay with that.
