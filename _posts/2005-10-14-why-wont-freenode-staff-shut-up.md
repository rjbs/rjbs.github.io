Seriously, if I ever go 48 hours without seeing a global notice on freenode IRC, I think I will fall over in disbelief.

"Um, hey guys, we're a little slow, that's all.  No worries."

"Hey, me again.  Someone was trying to attack us with a dictionary attack.  I guess some of you should change your passwords."

"Ok, new policy, from now on, if you're not registered, you can only privmsg once a day, except on days when somebody screwed up the server."

"We are now known as Freenode, and no longer as freenode irc.  Thanks."

"What's up everybody?  Sorry to bother you, but I lost my keys.  If everyone could check under their channel's sofa, that would be great."
