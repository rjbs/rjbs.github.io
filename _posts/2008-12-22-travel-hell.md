The plan, yesterday, was (all times shown in Eastern):

    08:00 leave home
    10:00 arrive PHL airport
    11:20 depart PHL, heading to MEM (Memphis)
    14:20 arrive MEM
    15:30 depart MEM, heading to PNS (Pensacola)
    16:30 arrive PNS, picked up by in-laws

Instead, this is what happened:

    08:00 leave home, travel on slush-covered highways full of scary drivers
    10:30 arrive PHL airport, panicked about being too late to check baggage
    10:45 check in; clerk says, "You don't have to make any connections, right?"
    11:20 flight delayed until 12:15
    12:15 flight delayed until 13:11
    13:11 flight delayed until 13:40
    14:00 flight departs
    15:30 flight for PNS leaves without us
    18:00 flight arrives in MEM, late due to 195mph headwinds (!)
          told we've been rebooked for a flight the next day
          ask ticketing agent to route us to an airport near PNS tonight
          spend three hours trying to keep toddler entertained in small airport
    21:00 depart MEM headed for VPS (Ft. Walton Beach), 40 mi from Pensacola
    22:15 arrive in VPS; our baggage has been "expedited" to Pensacola
          the baggage guy tells us that if we rush to Penscola, we can get it
          before the staff goes home for the night
    00:00 arrive at PNS by car, everything is dark; find someone closing up and
          he gets our bags!
    00:30 get to in-laws, only eight hours late

NWA gave us some food coupons in Memphis, and we got dinner at the Blue Note
Cafe.  It was total airport food.  Martha's diet for most of yesterday was
french fries, although she had a complete breakfast and ended the day with some
dried apricots.

The in-laws told us how we'd brought the cold down with us, and we'd be glad we
had jackets on, but it was still at least fifty degrees out.  Today we're only
expecting about fifty again, but the rest of the week is going to be in the
seventies.  I packed *shorts*.  I'm hoping that the weather will make up for
the travel.
