At first, I wrote this introduction to this entry:

* Black Sabbath, The Wizard
* Black 47, Time to Go
* Cake, Sad Songs and Waltzes
* Black 47, Born to Be Free
* Bob Dylan, Mozambique
* Bruce Springsteen, Downtown Train
* Bob Dylan, Thin Man's Blues (?)

* Bjork
* Bush, Glycerine

* Black 47, Born to be Free (again!)
* Black Sabbath, The Wizard (x3)
* Bone Thugs-n-Harmony

By this point, though, I got suspicious.  I stopped to review my actual
playlist.  My Shuffle, which is supposed to contain everything from my Shuffle
playlist -- that's 103 songs at the moment -- instead contains thirty-five
songs.  Some of them, like Bjork, don't even appear in my Shuffle playlist at
the moment.

Sometimes I really, really wish that the iPod devices kept their database of
music in a really easy to read (documented) format.  If they did, I could
easily write my own software to build and sync playlists.  I could still have
playlists like those I've enjoyed for so long, but I could make them much more
enjoyable with constraints like, "no more than n% of playlist contents may be
from a single artist."

When a friend of mine started talking about getting an iAudio recently, I
replied to his LVLUG posting saying that I was too addicted to the "last
played" and "play count" and "rating" features supported by iTunes and the iPod
players.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  I can build really useful smart
playlists, but I'm chained to the slow, bloated iTunes player when working at
my laptop, and I'm stuck with lousy syncing on the shuffle and glaring feature
omissions on all the smart playlists.  Don't get me started on the fact that
iTunes still doesn't have a "Update Playlist Contents" context menu item for
non-auto-updating smart playlists.

Will someone please release a reasonable mp3 player that keeps track of these
things?  I am longing to abandon iTunes, but until something else can deal with
iPod's database, or until another player can produce this kind of data, I am
too addicted.
