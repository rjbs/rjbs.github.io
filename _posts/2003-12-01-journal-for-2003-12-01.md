The truth!

## back to the grind

I went to work today.  It was fine.

I didn't get as much done as I would've liked to, and I was pretty annoyed that no one else could make the (important to me) development meeting.  Still, I'm cool and relaxed.  Vacation helped.  Tomorrow I hope to accomplish more.

At lunch, I showed Steve how to play Zendo, and he enjoyed it, which made me happy.  I need more people who are willing to play fun games.  Seriously!  I also discussed with him the idea of making a cool custom box for my icehouse pieces.  I think our final ideas weren't half bad, and I look forward to seeing a prototype!  It would be nice to have something in which to take pieces to the UK.  Failing that, to OSCON '04!

So, I didn't manage to make arrangements, yet, for my next trip to the UK.  I need to look into that tomorrow.  Maybe I can get a flight out of ABE.  That'd be OK.  If it ends up costing less than the commute and parking at EWR, it'd be worth it.  I think my real goals (in order) are: get home at a reasonable time on the 16th, fly business class, fly from ABE.  I really hate flying coach for transatlantic flights.  I feel all compressed and uncomfortable.

## music

My iPod continues to rule.  I have it set up to sync recently-added unrated music, so today I remembered that I hadn't listened to Quadrophenia enough and I just brought up the album and played it.  It's good.  I especially like "Dirty Jobs" and "The Punk and the Godfather."

iTunes, too, is Just Fine.  It continues to make it possible for me to notice that I have really good music that I can't remember ever hearing before.  I guess maybe XMMS could have done this somehow, but it seems unlikely.  I remain happy with knave, and I'm hoping to convince a few more people to pick up Apples this winter.  If only there was a referral bonus!
