Every time I blindly click a "Contact Us" link and see Mail.app launching, my
teeth itch.  It takes too long, it complains about certs, and I don't want to
freaking send any mail with Mail.app anyway!  Why can't I use mutt?

Well, I found out that I can!  There's a program called
[MailtoMutt](http://nothingmuch.woobling.org/MailtoMutt/) that lets you use
mutt to handle mailto: links.

The page noted that the icon contained a picture of "Yuval's dog."  I was
surprised to see the name "Yuval," since I've only ever seen it once before,
and I thought I'd ask our own Yuval Kogman whether it was at all a common name.
A few moments later, looking through bug reports, I saw one from "nothingmuch."
Then I realized that it was hosted at his familiar domain.

Thanks, Yuval!  Now I can click links secure in the knowledge that I will not
get angry.
