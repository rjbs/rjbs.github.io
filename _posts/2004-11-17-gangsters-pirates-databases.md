I spent a lot of my weekend playing GTA: San Andreas.  A lot.  Maybe too much. I got to the pleasant part of the game where I had four or five missions available at any given time.  As I recall from Vice City, it's the best part. Once you get to a bottleneck of one or two missions, it gets really frustrating.  There's an extent to which you can just tool around and have fun, but when large sections of the game are still off limits, that gets frustrating.  Anyway, it's staying fun, although I'm still a pretty horrible driver.  I do feel like I'm better this time around than I was in VC.  I'm thinking about sticking Vice City in sometime to see if I can beat any of the missions that I left undone.

Today I started my most newly-acquired game, Metroid Prime 2.  Gloria went to EBX to pick up my pre-order for me while I was working, despite the fact that she knows I'll probably obsess over it.  I played for a little under two hours tonight.  It's good.  It's a whole lot like Metroid Prime, which is good.  It's the Majora's Mask of Metroid Primes, and I'm A-OK with that.  I'm looking forward to getting some crazy new gear, though.  So far, just bombs and double jump.

In the moments between games (and other things) I've been working on Rubric, which is actually looking nice.  Sure, it's missing wildly important features (new user registration, deleting of links) but it's enough for me to use, and one or two other people are playing with it.  I feel pretty good about it, and I think it's going to go well.  I just need to stick with it for a while longer.

I've also been re-reading Programming Ruby, and it just reminds me how much I love that language.  I need to make more time for using it, possibly by finding a killer app in it, so I can play around.  (With a name like Rubric, I should've thought to write that in Ruby!)  My big problem is always, "I can do what I want in Perl, and quickly.  Why use something else?"  I need to get involved with existing code.  Existing code that doesn't suck.
