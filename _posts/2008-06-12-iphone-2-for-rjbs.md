I was sure that when iPhone 2 came out I'd get one.  The new price makes it pretty attractive, too.  Then again, one of the reasons I was so eager to get one was that I was stuck with that piece of crap Samsung.  Now I have my RAZR back, which is a nice phone.  Then again, just yesterday my five year old iPod finally gave up the ghost, so I have no portable music player.

Augh!

I guess what I need to do is figure out how much more I'll be paying a month if I move both Gloria and myself to AT&T, possibly both with iPhones.
