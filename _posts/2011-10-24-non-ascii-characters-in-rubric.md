Only what… seven years after its first release, I’ve finally added tolerable
support for “funny character” to Rubric.  It wasn't all that hard – it had the
usual problems.  I knew what I should’ve done to begin with, but then I had to
figure out all the stupid things I had done before that, and had to undo them.

Thanks for this fix goes to MJD, who gave me a joking hard time about using
‘--’ instead of ‘–’ in my last post.

I’m sure it's still busted in some way, but at least I made a start.
