Okay, I'm being overly dramatic.  MobileMe has been mostly okay to me.  It's nice that it syncs things, and I guess having them pushed over the air is kind of neat.  It doesn't really excite me.  I dumped a crapload of my files onto my iDisk and maybe some day that will pay off.

Mostly, though, it's just a tax I pay to sync all my data, because there's no good, well-implemented open standard that I can rely on for something other than MobileMe.  Fine, I don't mind.

What bugs me, though, is the calendars.

See, if you use "push" calendar syncing, your subscription calendars aren't pushed.  If (say) your wife also uses iCal and also syncs her calendar to MobileMe, you can't get that calendar to show up on your push-synced iPhone, even though you can get it to show up in your pull-synced iCal.

The solution is to turn off push sync for calendars and let iTunes sync things manually.  That's fine.  It doesn't bother me at all... but why, oh why, must it change the darn colors used on my calendars?  Gloria's calendar is no longer pink on my phone.  ABE.pm is no longer cyan.  Why would it change that?  Argh!
