I gave my Sub::Exporter talk, this morning.  (I'll put up my slides soon, once I find a nice way to publish them.)  I think it went well.  I went over time, but toward the end I just annoucned that I was not going to stop.  Some people left and some stuck around.  I'm not sure how well it was received in general, but I didn't feel like I made any huge mistakes, and I got to say everything I wanted to.

I did have more than one person suggest Sub::Exporter::Cookbook, which is something I'd thought about doing and then abandoned.  I'll probably start on that soon, which should be fun.

I'll write more about other talks later, I think.  I'm in Andy's talk on technical debt, now, and I'm enjoying it too much to engage in a brain dump.
