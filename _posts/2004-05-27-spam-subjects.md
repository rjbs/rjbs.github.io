I have a huge archive of spam.  I'm actually a little surprised, now, to see it's about 450 megs.  Today, I got a piece of spam with this incredible subject:

 Subject: does your man fuck you every day?   godparent                         

I think I need to run through the spam and find the good bits.  There must be a few, the question is just how hard they'll be to find.  Maybe it's time to write Bryar::DataSource::Maildir.

That and find out what the point is behind spammers' weird practises like sticking "godparent" at the end of a fuck-related question.
