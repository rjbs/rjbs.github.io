**What is Moose?**

<center><img src='/talks/moose/what-is-moose.jpg' /></center>

What is this mysterious library that is taking the CPAN by storm?  Why would
you ever want to use it?  Will it really make your code incredibly slow?
What's a meta-object protocol, anyway?  Does it have natural resistance to
*Charm* and *Sleep*?  **And why is it called Moose??**

If you don't know, yet, why you should love Moose, I am prepared to beat that
love into you with three hours of [GIANT CODE
SLIDES](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17828), full of
all your favorite sigils:  dollar sign, at sign, percent sign, and for a
limited time, brief appearances by ampersand and asterisk.  As a special bonus,
Lisp will be mentioned.

How does all of this relate to Dungeons and Dragons, and why are Black Mage and
Megaman arguing across the slides?  Slide 21 depicts four 30-sided dice,
despite the fact that they are *good for nothing*.  Can Moose remove 33% of
their sides?

A brief intermission will be held during which time there will be complimentary
coffee and snacks.  Terrified audience members are free to flee the building
during this time.

Now it can be told:  even my *surname* has become a discounting word!  Use
"**Signes**" as a coupon code when you [register right
now](https://en.oreilly.com/oscon2011/public/register).  You will save
200&#x2030; and for every five registrants, a free admission will be granted to
one bewildered stranger from off the street.
