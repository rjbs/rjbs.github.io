I've been making a nice little dent in my <a href='http://rjbs.manxome.org/todo/books'>reading list</a>, lately, on account of my time on the bus.  Today I finished Eats, Shoots & Leaves.  Tomorrow I'll have to take something else to start, and I'm not super-anxious to spend a lot of time on my current set of books.  I think I'll try to finish Orthodoxy, next.

Eats, Shoots & Leaves was very enjoyable.  I didn't get much out of it except for a few hour of enjoyment, but that's not bad at all.  It's about what I got from the Fletch books I read, but a book about punctuation seems like a higher pleasure than one about an investigative reporter.

I hope I can make some real progress through my queue before I go off and buy too many more books.  (I won't feel too bad, though, if I buy some more Fletch.)
