I'm still really enjoying my Sony PRS-300.  It's a good piece of hardware and
reading on it is pretty pleasant.  I've been reading mostly free material, much
of which is old stuff in the public domain.  I've also read two Stephen King
books that I bootlegged.

I feel bad about that.  I would like to pay for the book.  I'm not sure how
much I'd pay.  I'd like to pay less than the book costs on the bookshelf, but I
guess I might be willing to pay the same.  After all, I end up with the same
book.  I can't write on the pages, but it also won't clutter up my house.

Unfortunately, Sony's incredibly horrible online bookstore seems to charge a
highly discounted version of the *hardcover* price.

Here are some comparisons:

    Book           | Sony List | Sony  | Mass Market
                   | Price     | Price | Paperback
    ---------------+-----------+-------+-------------
    Carrie         | $32.50    | $13   | $8
    'Salem's Lot   | $35       | $13   | $8
    The Shining    | $35       | $13   | $8
    The Stand      | $50       | $35   | $9
    From a Buick 8 | $8        | $8    | $8
    Gunslinger     | $8        | $8    | $8

Quite a few books have prices that match up.  Plenty of others don't.  I wish
these prices would get in line.  I also wish that I could buy them in my web
browser.  Sony's software for using their store is absolutely abysmal.
