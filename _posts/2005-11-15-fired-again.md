Last night, I had the same dream as the night before.  I got fired.  I worked for and with the same people, but I was a comic book writer/illustrator.  We produced a number of comics, including the one I worked on the most.  Its name was something like "Hellboy."  Maybe it was Hellboy, but it wasn't the real Hellboy comic.  I think I wrote an issue in which the narrator spoke about how his china cabinet was a gateway to hell.

I probably would've fired me, too.
