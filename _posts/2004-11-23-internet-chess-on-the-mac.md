It seems like there's no big consensus on "Good Mac Chess Software."

I wish there was more chess software that played with a GnuChess engine /and/ on the free chess servers.  Maybe there is a strong reason for this not being the case.  I should investigate!

Anyway, I have found Fixation, which runs on OS X and connects to FICS (freechess.org) where I am rjbs.
