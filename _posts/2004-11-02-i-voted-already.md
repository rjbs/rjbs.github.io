I voted, I voted!  Please, please, PLEASE stop calling me and telling me to vote, to vote for someone, to vote against someone, or to vote in a particular form of dress.  Tonight they will count votes, and by Friday, we will have a clear President-Elect.  I DEMAND IT.

I voted for three democrats and two greens.  It was a small ballot this year.
