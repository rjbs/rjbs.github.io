I don't use Module::Install or Module::Starter anymore.  For the most part, I
don't think anyone should.  I think there are better tools to use instead.

That said, if you *really like* using them, I have some plugins that I am no
longer interested in maintaining:

* Module::Install::AuthorTests
* Module::Install::ExtraTests
* Module::Starter::Plugin::SimpleStore
* Module::Starter::Plugin::TT2

That's all I have to say.
