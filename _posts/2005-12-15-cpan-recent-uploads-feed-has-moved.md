I noticed a while ago that the CPAN's feed had stopped uploading.  Most of my ability to write useful code hinges on the fact that I know the CPAN's contents pretty well, and keep up to date on it.  The loss of this feed did not bode well for me.

Randal pointed me to another feed, but it sucked: its links were not to the dist pages, but to downloads.

I just went to the CPAN search page and found a new feed.  Not only is it up to date, but its creator field is populated, and it has the dist's abstract.  I wish this had been announced somewhere -- like maybe in the old feed!
