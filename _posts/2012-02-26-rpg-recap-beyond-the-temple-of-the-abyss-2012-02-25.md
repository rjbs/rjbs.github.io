## Saturday, the 7th day of the Red Moon, 937

With the death of Alp and Jared the Acolytes, the rest of the party made
their way back to the surface and then back to Edgwold to recuperate.

## Monday, the 9th day of the Red Moon, 937

After a full day off, Torben, Mero, and Lyweylln were still not ready to head
back to the Gladwell place.  Derick had already had plenty of time off,
though, and Delian was looking for revenge.  Rocky and Rigby, the
mercenaries, were ready for some more treasure.

Before heading back to the caverns, Derick decided to get in on the looting
he'd missed out on while down below.  He boldly strode into the priest's
quarters, knocked in the doors to Alp and Jared's quarters and took most
interesting stuff: the sickly spiderfrog in its cage and the big blue lapis
lazuli.  Old Buckner the apothecary paid 250 gold sovereigns for the
spiderfrog, and 300 for Delian's few remaining seeds.

With most of their gold stashed in their quarters, Delian and Derick rounded
up Rocky and Rigby and headed south to the Gladwells'.  Once there, they had
an irritating revelation:  they had neither Torben's map (which he'd taken
with him) nor Jared's, which had been looted by nobody-knew-whom.
Fortunately for them, both Delian and Derick were getting to be old hands at
this and remembered exactly how to get to their destination: the old dwarfish
mine.

They were there in no time, and ready to face the skeletons from which they'd
fled, last time.  What they *weren't* read for was a four-foot spiderfrog
leaping out of the darkness at the east end of the mine's top chamber.  Read
or not, though, they made short work of it.  Within seconds, Derick had
beaten it to death.  The group had had their fill of spiderfrogs by this
point, and left the corpse alone.  They split into two groups and found the
inanimate skeletons.  Derick and Delian each attacked a skeleton, and at that
the undead sprang to their feet and engaged the party.

Rigby got to work loading the treasure into his pack while everyone else
engaged the skeletons.  The fight was quick and brutal, but in the end, the
living prevailed with no losses.  The treasure was divided more evenly
– mostly due to its great weight – and the group decided to press its luck
and head forward.

They righted one of the mine carts and got it on the rails.  Rocky, Rigby,
and Delian squeezed into the cart and Derick pushed.  This proved to be one
of the best ideas of the day, because as soon as the cart began to pass
through the northern passage, a huge pendulum blade swung down from a channel
in the jamb, crashing into the cart instead of an unsuspecting adventurer.
The group was shaken, but not sliced.

They were *further* shaken to hear a chorus of shouting voices from the
northern passage, speaking Draconic.  The group quickly hauled the mine cart
in front of the passage to form a makeshift blockade and fell back a bit.  A
wave of shouting kobolds emerged from the darkness, charging the barricade.
Derick felled two with arrows before they reached the carts, and Rocky's axe
killed two more.  When another wave emerged from the darkness, though, Delian
finished things by casting *Sleep*.  As the remaining seven kobolds lay
peacefully in slumber, the party climbed over the carts and slit their seven
throats.

Derick gathered up their treasure: a whopping 122 copper pieces.

At the bottom of the shaft, they found a large chamber – again of fine
dwarfish construction – with its far end sealed off with a strange wall
cobbled together from pieces of this and that.  In the center of its base was
a set of small double doors, and in that a small slot at (kobold) eye level.
As Derick peered through, another kobold appeared on the other side.  Derick
cleverly gouged at the kobold's eyes, but had his fingers bitten for the
trouble.  Delian tried to press for information, but the kobold was not
cooperating, especially after Delian apologized "for killing all [his]
friends."  When the slot opened again to throw a vial of burning oil at the
elf, the party decided to give up for now and try the south passage.

Their descent here was slow: the passage was damp and occasionally quite
slippery.  Here and there, sticky blue strands nearly a quarter inch thick
ran from wall to wall.  Rigby judged them no serious threat and burned them
way with his torch.  Further down, the party began to find weird metal clamps
attached to the rails, one of which had a length of (not sticky) blue braided
rope attached to it.  Derick pulled the rest of the rope up.  At the far end
was the severed upper half of a goblin in weird copper-and-lizard-skin armor
and wearing a large spherical helmet with a crystal front plate.  Inside, the
grimacing face was surrounded by purple fungus.  Derick made a half-hearted
attempt to remove the plate from the helmet, but gave up quickly.  He
couldn't cut the blue rope, and so smashed the clamp to bits and tossed the
whole thing into his pack.

At the bottom of the tunnel was another room like the one with the kobolds'
wall, but this one was badly damaged, and mostly submerged beneath cold, dark
water.  A few dead and shriveled kobold corpses were scattered around and
Derick, hoping for more copper, began to rifle through them.  The purple
fungus covering their bodies, at least, was happy for the attention.  It
released a cloud of spores that left Derick choking and clutching his throat.
Delian hauled him away by the ankle and decided it was time to get the heck
out of the caves.

The group carried him Derick back through the mine shaft, down out of the
mines, up through the complex junction, into the butchery, and up into the
stable... where the purple splotches that had begun to dot his face and
throat began to blacken and smolder.  In a panic, Delian sent Rocky and Rigby
back into the caves while he went back to town for help.

While he was gone, Derick came to, feeling like crap, and with Rocky hovering
nervously over him with an axe.  Shortly thereafter, the sound of shuffling
and moaning could be heard from a nearby passage.  Derick send the henchmen
away with the loot and made a last stand.

He fought valiantly, dispatching one zombie and surviving blow after blow
from the others.  Eventually, though, with both his arms broken and several
ribs cracked, he succumbed.  When Delian returned with Esbert the Acolyte,
the whole group went back in for Derick's body.  They emerged victorious
with Derick's remains, having slain the remaining zombies and only lost
Esbert, who never seemed quite ready for the whole experience.

With the corpses and treasure loaded up, the group made tracks for home.
