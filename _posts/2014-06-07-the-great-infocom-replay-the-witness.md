It's been over a month since I last tried to do anything on my
still-crawling-along (re)playthrough of all of Infocom's games.  The next up,
for me, was [The
Witness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witness_%281983_video_game%29).  I'm
going to be straight with you:  I didn't play it.

I made a map, and I got to the game's introduction, and I read all of the
manual and [feelies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelie).  I played a few
turns of what could fairly be called "the game."  The fact of the matter is
that I just could not work up any enthusiasm for it at all.  I like murder
mysteries, but I like to watch them.  I never try to solve them ahead of time.
It doesn't interest me in the least.

From Suspect, I knew that's what would be expected of me, and I knew it
wouldn't be fun.

So I'm skipping it.  I played enough to know I wouldn't have any fun at all,
and if I ever write more IF, I won't be writing a mystery, so nevermind, okay?

Next up is Planetfall, which I've played before, but I hope to enjoy it a bit
more this time.  I had very mixed feelings about it, last time.
