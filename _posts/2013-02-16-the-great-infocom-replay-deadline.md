Last weekend, I went to Las Vegas for a one-day trip to attend a party in honor
of my father's many years coaching rugby.  It was a great event, but the travel
was, as usual, not a big bowl of cherries.  I decided to make the most of it,
though, and play Deadline on the plane.

I loaded the story file into [Frotz](https://code.google.com/p/iphonefrotz/) on
my iPad and put the manual into
[GoodReader](http://www.goodiware.com/goodreader.html).  Using my iPad to play
was a great plan, once I also started using my wireless keyboard (presumably in
violation of some sort of regulation).  Using my laptop would've been
impossible in that cramped seat, but the iPad worked a charm, apart from
occasional glitches in Frotz.

I was looking forward to Deadline, because it was the first Infocom game I'd be
"replaying" that I hadn't actually played before.  I had probably started it up
and poked around for a few minutes, but I hadn't played the game in earnest.
This was my chance to pretend that I was living in 1982, playing a brand new
Infocom game ... in flight, on a touchscreen tablet.  Well, the illusion of
novelty wasn't the important thing.

Spoilers follow.

I enjoy a good murder mystery, and I decided I'd really try to solve this one.
The Deadline feelies include a number of witness interviews.  From those, I
produced a timeline of events, noting what was probably fact and what was only
testimony.  Arriving at the scene of the crime, I made a survey of the grounds
(one again cursing the asymmetry of the map exits) and figured out which
windows led to which part of the estate.  This would prove useful later.

I intercepted mail, rifled through medicine cabinets, conducted thorough
interviews, snooped on phone calls, and tried to figure out where characters
were sneaking off to.  I felt like a real detectiveâ€¦ almost.  There were
problems.  For one, it was clear that I'd have to follow some characters around
to see what they were doing, but it wasn't clear whom to follow.  It meant that
I had to do that most boring of adventure game chores: start over, over and
over and over.

I didn't mind all that much, actually, because in many ways it reminded me of
Suspended, a game I love.  As I played, I expanded my timeline of events to
include events that would happen during the day.  Nine fifteen, a phone call.
Ten o'clock, the mail arrives.  Eleven thirty, Angus gets angry about holes in
his garden.  Noon, a reading of the will.  As I built up more of this timeline,
by playing and failing over and over, I began to find the critical path to
being everywhere I needed to me.  Every time I played, I could do every
required action to learn every important fact.  This was satisfying.

Learning these facts, on the other hand, was often very dissatisfying.  I was
often correct in my assumptions about what was going on.  I often knew what I
had to do.  I just didn't know how to do it.  It was a "guess the verb" puzzle
on a very frustrating level.

There were a number of drugs around the house, and many of them were
labeled with warnings about drug interactions.  They also had the names
of the dispensing pharmacy.  I couldn't call the pharmacist to ask, "How
would Allergone interact with Ebullion?"  I couldn't even ask the
coroner to check for these drugs in the victim's system:

Well, Duffy, ask at the morgue!

Later, I'd find traces of a drug on a piece of ceramic.  Even if I'd already
had that drug in particular analyzed, the lab would just say "well, it's
not a common medication, anyway."

Later, I would resort to InvisiClues.  This was almost as frustrating as
trying to pieces things together myself, at least when it came to
figuring out why on earth George would stand around outside doing
nothing for an hour.  The clue urged me to do something, but I couldn't
guess the verb.

In the end, I played the game until I knew who had killed Mr. Robner,
and why, and how.  It's possible I could have solved the game, had I
stuck with it for another few hours.  I realize that a single five hour
flight is not how one might usually expect to play Deadline.  Then
again, it did get five hours of my time, which seemed like quite a lot.
More importantly, giving it more time wasn't going to lessen my
frustration, but only increase it.

I think that an IF game could be a very good way to present a murder
mystery, and I hope to find another one that I love.  This one, though,
is not one I'll recommend to friends.  Maybe Witness...
