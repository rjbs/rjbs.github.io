I've done a bit of poking at Module::CPAN::Generator and put together my own cpants.db.  I also tweaked my cpants Querylet, so I can look at my Kwalitee results and find that... dangit!  Rubric 0.12 left use strict out of a module somewhere.  Argh!  I need to (a) get domm to let me give him updated cpants.db for the website or (b) run my own version of the website.
