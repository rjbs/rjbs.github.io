I've been working on changing the way my mailflow works, mostly so that I can
benefit from the work that I do at Pobox.  In order to get rid of some of my
old email addresses, I've been updating a *lot* of user accounts and list
subscriptions.  Today, as I've started to get tax documents, I thought I'd
update my TurboTax account.

I logged in, but couldn't find a link to change my email address.  I looked
through help and found a link to a page that didn't help.  I looked harder and
found step-by-step instructions.  The second step instructed me to click a link
that didn't exist.

I contacted the live web chat -- a feature that I've grown pretty fond of,
these last few months -- and I got a link to their [change of email
form](https://turbotax.intuit.com/support/ecr/form.jhtml).  It includes the
following text:

> To process your e-mail change request, we require documentation that
> establishes your identity. We can accept these documents via fax or as
> digital scans. Any photo ID submitted should be clear enough to make out the
> features of the person pictured in the ID. 

I started at this for a minute and then asked, "So, I can't change my email
address if I don't own a scanner or fax machine?"

My new friend, 03_Alfred Tamayo, said he'd look into it, and then replied that,
"Yes Sir, you should have a scanner or fax machine in order to send the
information, you can try it in some other computer who have that."

So... even though I have login credentials, and you'll give me all my past tax
information, and you'll send me commercial email.  You just won't let me change
*where* you send that email.

I will be using someone else to file my taxes this year.  Thanks, TurboTax!  Go
get bent!
