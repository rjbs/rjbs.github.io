Last night, looking at my bookshelf, I noticed my copy of Animal Farm and
decided to re-read it.  By the time I was finishing the first chapter, the
entirety of the rest of the book flooded back into my memory, and I felt like
weeping for the tragedy I knew was coming, eventually.

Animal Farm and 1984 remain two of my favorite books for rereading.

Do not forget Old Major's teaching:

> All the habits of Man are evil.  And, above all, no animal must ever
> tyrannise over his own kind.  Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are
> all brothers.  No animal must ever kill any other animal.  All animals are
> equal.
