Over a decade ago, Paul Elliott wrote a tiny piece of counterfactual history
called [The Gygax/Arneson
Tapes](http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/tempus12nov02.html).  It
recounts the history of the world's most famous role-playing game, Mazes &
Minotaurs, in which the players take on larger-than-life Greek-style heroes in
Sword and Sandal adventures.

A while later, the amazing Olivier Legrand "dug up and published" the [original
1972 rules for Mazes & Minotaurs](http://storygame.free.fr/OLDMAZES.htm).  Of
course, in reality he wrote it.  All of it.  It's a complete, good, playable
RPG written based on a little half page of inspiration, also inspired by the
little brown books of D&D.

Then, later, he produced the [1987 "revised"
edition](http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/revised.html).  This gives us the
three core books you'd expect: the player's manual, the Maze Master's guide,
and the creature compendium.  Later came the M&M Companion, Viking & Valkyries
(an alternate setting), and perhaps most amazingly of all, [Minotaur
Quarterly](http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/quarterly.html), an excellent
magazine of add-on material for RM&M.  Of course, sometimes it included
"republished" articles from the days of OM&M.

The whole set of books is well done.  They're all written as if the false
history is true, and with a bit of tongue in cheek, but they're still good,
playable games.

For about a year and a half, give or take, I ran [a modified M&M
game](http://dudgeonmaster.org/games/alar/) and it went well.  I might run it
again some day, either in that same setting or in the canonical Mythika, if I
get around to watching a bunch more
[peplum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sandal) films.  I advise all
fellow old school RPG fans to give M&M a look.
