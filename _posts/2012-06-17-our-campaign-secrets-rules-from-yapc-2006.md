At [YAPC North America](http://yapcna.org/) this year, swag included
[Campaign Secrets](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11020/campaign-secrets),
a card game about the US presidential election.  This game was also swag in
2006, and I played quite a few games of it with Dieter Pearcey and John
Cappiello, many of them at the airport waiting to go home.

We liked the idea of the game, but we also made quite a few changes to try to
make it play differently.  (As I recall, we wanted to avoid an early snowball
effect where one player was clearly going to win and we were just waiting for
the game-ending cards.)

Here are the changes, which I wrote up on the YAPC 2006 wiki at the time:

### Funding Cards

The "well funded" and "poorly funded" campaign cards are unclear. They should
be read to mean that the candidate can keep one more card or one fewer card in
his hand at the end of each turn. In other words, he may draw up to six cards
(well funded) or only up to four cards (poorly funded) at the end of each turn.
These cards remain in front of the player, but are discarded when primaries
occur.

### Prevent Endorsement Flip-Flops

Endorsements and nominations are not discarded when played or shuffled back
into the deck. They remain in front of the player who received the nomination.
This prevents multiple nominations for one party in one game.

### Major and Minor Party Nominations

A candidate may be nominated for any number of "third parties," or for one
major party. (The major parties are, of course, the Democrats and Republicans.)
This can be used to try and get a number of 5% boosts, or offensively to
prevent an opponant from getting a major party nom.

### You Know Your Secrets

When a secret is played on you, you may look at it. Otherwise, you'd need to
keep track of which secrets you played on yourself and which were played on
you. Since you can trade secrets with others, this is weird and annoying
behavior.  Also, it means that your opponants can probably tell which were
played against you are are, therefore, probably better ones to reveal.

### Two-part Deck

Instead of playing with the whole deck twice (once before primaries, once
before the election), the deck is divided in two. One is the primary deck (and
contains the Primaries) and one is the election deck (and contains Election
Day). The primary's discards are not resuffled into the election deck. This can
help make the game faster and ensure that there is more of the vote up for
grabs after the primaries.

### Nominations Before Primaries

Using the two-part deck rule, above, make sure that all party nominations are
in the primary deck. Optionally, if a candidate is not nominated before the
primaries, play out cards into the discard pile until a party nomination is
revealed. If more than one candidate lacks a party nomination, play out cards
for one candidate, then the next, until all are nominated.

### The Eternal Undecided

Set aside 15% (or your own chosen percentage) of the vote which will remain
undecided until election day. On election day, these voters are up for grabs
toward revealed Secrets. Each candidate in turn (following normal turn order)
may reveal one secret to gain its benefit from the pool.
