A few months ago, Salve Nilsen was asking `#perl-qa` about interest in a QA and
testing hackathon in Oslo.  I thought this sounded like a great idea and
volunteered a bunch of names of people who I thought would be interested (or at
least interesting).  I humbly humbly put my own name in that list, and as it
turned out, I got connected with a sponsor and I'll be headed to the [Oslo QA
Hackathon](http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/Oslo_QA_Hackathon_2008)
this week.  I'm on [ABC Startsiden](http://www.startsiden.no/)'s dime.  If you
haven't heard of them, you're not Norwegian.  They're (from my understanding)
the most popular site in Norway.

A lot of the [confirmed
attendees](http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/Oslo_QA_Hackathon_2008_:_Attendees)
have got an agenda, or at least have some projects that they are likely to be
talking about.  I'm feeling pretty free, though.  There are lots of
[topics](http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php/Oslo_QA_Hackathon_2008_:_Topics)
and quite a few of them actually look quite interesting and useful to me.  I'm
hoping to see some good things happen with TAP-producing modules, and with the
installation toolchain.  Quite a few of us get to Oslo on Friday, and hopefully
while we get our bearings in the city and take some photos, we'll also start
figuring out what we're going to get done.
