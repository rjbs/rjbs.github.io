I love my home state of Pennsylvania, and usually it's quite beautiful.  Today, though, it's been pouring rain.  The earth was already soft because of the piles of melting snow and ice, and now the topsoil has become a mudflow everywhere, flooding rivers with dirt.  As I look out the window on the bus, the whole countryside looks like a backed up toilet.

Ugh.
