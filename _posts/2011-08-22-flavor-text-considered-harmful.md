I really don't like the "flavor text" used in 4E D&D power descriptions.  It is
far too often just flavor, with no subtance.  It isn't clear what the power
really means.  It's just a sentence or two trying to remind you that this
abstract tactical maneuver is supposed to be related to your class's theme, and
not just a set of mechanics.  This goes back to the Alexandrian's excellent
[Dissociated
Mechanics](http://thealexandrian.net/creations/misc/dissociated-mechanics.html)
post from 2008.

Here's an example:

    Shared Madness, Avenger Attack 1, Ranged 10
    Encounter Power
    Keywords: Divine, Implement, Psychic
    Standard Action
    Target: One creature

    The wrath of your god sears the mind of one foe and echoes to assault
    another enemy as well.

    Attack: Wisdom vs. Will
    Hit: 1d10 + Wisdom modifier psychic damage, and a second creature you can
    see takes the same damage.

The flavor text is the paragraph beginning "the wrathâ€¦"  What the heck does
that flavor text mean?  Here's what I can tell you about the power:  it does
psychic damage to two potentially distant targets, only one of whom you have to
roll to hit.  If you have a powerful holy symbol, the attack will be more
effective.

Okay, so what is my avenger actually doing?  *I have no idea.*  So, I want my
players to describe their actions, and not just say, "I roll to hit."  This
flavor text does nothing to explain what they might be doing.  I get, "I use
Shared Madness."  What does that mean?  Who knows!  I can press for a
description, but this slows gameplay and frustrates players.  At least with "I
make a basic melee attack," the player can very easily imagine what he's doing:
"I hit it with my axe" isn't great, but it's a significant improvement.

This problem is particularly prominent among powers that force movement.

Some flavor text -- in fact a lot of it -- is much better, so I don't want to
say that everything is lousy.  For example, the powers directly before and
after Shared Madness are quite well, and minimally, described:

> Avenging Echo: Your weapon sweeps in a deadly arc, leaving in its wake
> swirling radiant energy that keeps your foes at bay.

> Whirlwind Charge: As you charge your foe, divine light surrounds you in a
> protective nimbus, then erupts at your foe.

This is good stuff.  It gives a "I just wanna kill stuff" player just enough to
say *something*, and can serve as a starting point for players who like to give more elaborate descriptions.

There's another extreme, though.  For example:

> Reaping Strike:  You punctuate your scything attacks with wicked jabs and
> small cutting blows that slip through your enemy's defenses.

What if I'm using a mace?  Or a great axe?  Or a two-handed sword?  That
description sounds great for someone fighting with a short sword, but not for
lots of other things.  What happens when the flavor text makes the power seem
impossible to use in given conditions, but all the requirements are met?  It
seems somewhat perverse to disallow a power because of its flavor text, but
then what does the power actually represent?

I'm hoping that Wizards will use their "constantly editing the rules" powers to
continually edit flavor text to give things simple, easy-to-adapt,
unrestrictive flavor text.
