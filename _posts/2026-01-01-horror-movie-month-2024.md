Yesterday, I posted about the books I read in 2025, which made me remember that
I never posted about the (horror) movies we watched in October 2024.  So, I
thought I'd get around to that.  Of course this will be short and lossy, right?
It's been over a year.

Here's what we watched for Horror Movie Month in 2024, at least according to my
notes!

### October 1: [Raw (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/film/raw-2016/)

Girl goes to college, finally lets loose by becoming a cannibal.  This movie
was French and you'd know it even if you watched it dubbed.  It was okay.  It
was worth my time.

### October 2: [Tragedy Girls (2017)](https://letterboxd.com/film/tragedy-girls/)

Two high school girls who are interested in death try to make more of it
happen.  It was a horror-comedy, and it was fun.  Brianna Hildebrand, who you
may remember as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, was in it.

### October 4: [V/H/S/Beyond (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/film/v-h-s-beyond/)

Honestly, apart from the 2025 one, most of the V/H/S movies are about the same
to me:  mixed bags, but usually not quite worth the whole watch.  This one was
that too.  It had its moments.

### October 5: [Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/humanist-vampire-seeking-consenting-suicidal-person/)

Honestly, I'd watch just for "Want to see a French-Canadian horror movie?"

A young woman in a family of vampires *really* doesn't want to go hunt for
blood, but her parents have reluctantly become insistent.  She decides she'll
look for somebody who'd be willing to donate.

It was good, and sort of a horror-comedy.  It didn't feel like every other
movie, which was good.

### October 6: [Onyx the Fortuitous and the Talisman of Souls (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/onyx-the-fortuitous-and-the-talisman-of-souls/)

I liked this the least of everybody in my household, I think.  It was sometimes
pretty funny, but the main character got on my nerves.  I got the impression he
is a YouTube character with some following, maybe?  Like Ernest P. Worrell or
other over the top "originally in small doses" characters, he was just too much
here.

That said, we still make references to the guy's catch phrase, so it stuck with
us.

### October 6: [Cuckoo (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/film/cuckoo-2024/)

This was one of the big hits of "general horror movies of 2024", so I was glad
we got to watch it.  I liked it!  It wasn't perfect, but it did well at being
one of those "Why can't everybody else see how messed up this lovely place
really is?" movies.

### October 7: [Let the Wrong One In (2021)](https://letterboxd.com/film/let-the-wrong-one-in/)

This movie was really stupid and I liked it.  First off, there was a character
named Deco, which made me think of The Commitments, which won points.  Also,
Anthony Stewart Head.

Basically it's sort of a slapstick farcical vampire movie set in Ireland.
Honestly, "What if [some successful movie] but the protagonists were idiots?"
is a pretty good formula.

### October 8: [The Witches of Eastwick (1987)](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-witches-of-eastwick/)

Still a classic.

Sure, it's kind of a mess here and there, but it's got a great cast and it
*just goes for it*.  I read recently that there was talk about casting other
people (other than Jack Nicholson) as Daryl Van Horne, which seems like it
could only have been worse.  One name mentioned was Bill Murray.  What?!  This
was a nearly perfect vehicle for Jack Nicholson doing comedy, and Cher, Susan
Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer were a lot of fun, too.

The cherry scene!

### October 9: [Courtney Gets Possessed (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/courtney-gets-possessed/)

I barely remember this one.  I think it was funny enough?  Demonic hijinks at a
bachelorette party.

### October 10: [There's Something Wrong with the Children (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/theres-something-wrong-with-the-children/)

Two parents, their two kids, and an adult friend take a camping trip.  The kids
wander off in the woods and when they come back, they are… off.  Things keep
getting worse.

This was good.  It wasn't great, but it was good.  You want to yell, "Wake up,
people, your kids are *busted*!"

### October 12: [6:45 (2021)](https://letterboxd.com/film/6-45/)

It took me a while to remember this one.  It was okay.  A couple take a
ill-advised holiday to an island town, which leads to a deadly time loop.  It
was okay, but there are many better movies to watch instead.  (Look, maybe it's
better than I remember, but given I barely remember it…)

### October 13: [Oddity (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/film/oddity-2024/)

I didn't remember this until reading the synopsis, but it was quite good.  So
maybe my "it's bad because I don't remember it" take above is wrong!

A woman is murdered at her secluded fixer-upper in the countryside.  Later, her
twin sister shows up and is *really* weird.  What's going on?  You should just
watch it, probably.  Not a comedy.

### October 14: [Mr. Crocket (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/film/mr-crocket-2024/)

This is sort of like "what if there was a haunted video tape that showed you a
cutesy TV show for kids, but also it was evil?"  I wanted to like it, but it
was just ugly.  It wasn't fun or funny, just dark.  It wasn't darkly funny,
although *maybe* that was the goal.

### October 15: [Evil Dead Ⅱ (1987)](https://letterboxd.com/film/evil-dead-ii/)

I think we watched this because Marty hadn't seen it.  Look, it's fine.  It's a
lot better than the first version.  I think it's just not exactly my bag.  (I
really like Bruce Campbell, though!)

### October 16: [Cube (2021)](https://letterboxd.com/film/cube-2021-1/)

I really liked Cube!  This is not that movie, though, it's a 2021 *remake* from
Japan.  Don't bother.  It is worse in every way.  Maybe it's *okay*, but it's
not significantly different, so go with the original.

### October 18: [Zombie Town (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/zombie-town-2023/)

A reclusive movie director releases one more movie, and it turns everybody in
town into zombies.  Kids fight back.

This kind of movie could've been fun, but it wasn't.  It had two of the Kids in
the Hall in it!  What a waste.

### October 19: [The Finale (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-finale/)

Oh yeah, this one.

Murders start happening at a summer theater camp.  Everybody has a motive.  Who
did it?

Well, look, I think this was maybe better than the related Stage Fright, but it
was bad.  It was way too long.  It was sometimes nonsensical.  I do not
recommend it.

### October 19: [Invitation to Hell (1984)](https://letterboxd.com/film/invitation-to-hell/)

This gets huge points from me for "picked a weird premise and didn't back
down."  Wes Craven directs.  A family moves to a new planned town where the
father has taken a great new job.  Everybody is obsessed with the local country
club and its manager.  Like, weirdly obsessed.  What the heck is going on in
town?  Also, Robert Urich and Susan Lucci?  Wild.

Not great, but I am glad I watched it.

### October 20: [Corporate Animals (2019)](https://letterboxd.com/film/corporate-animals/)

A bunch of coworkers on a team-building exercise end up trapped in a cave.
Demi Moore?!  We had fun.  It was stupid in a good way.  The company
specialized in edible cutlery, which paid off a few ways.

### October 20: [Stranger in Our House (1978)](https://letterboxd.com/film/stranger-in-our-house/)

Wes Craven again, this time with Linda Blair.  It wasn't great, sadly, and the
concept has been done a bunch of times.  Orphaned kid moves in with other
family, and only one family member realizes that maybe this is a bad idea.  It
was… fine.

### October 24: [Little Evil (2017)](https://letterboxd.com/film/little-evil/)

Adam Scott becomes the step-dad to the Antichrist and really tries to make
things work.  This was not amazing, but it was much better than I expected.
I don't mind having watched it, but I wouldn't watch it again.

Good job casting the really creepy kid, though!

### October 25: [Deer Camp '86 (2022)](https://letterboxd.com/film/deer-camp-86/)

A bunch of guys go hunting and get into trouble.  I remember *nothing*.

### October 26: [The Day of the Beast (1995)](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-day-of-the-beast/)

A priest figures out how to predict the exact birth of the Antichrist, and
enlists the help of a headbanger and a TV occultist to save the world.  Was
this a comedy on purpose?  I just don't know.  It was weird, and unpredictable,
and so I liked it.

### October 27: [The Strangers (2008)](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-strangers/)

What a lousy movie to end on.  It's a boring, tedious home invasion movie.  I
see it was 86 minutes long, but I remember it feeling much longer.  Also, I
think they remade it into a three part movie?  I can't imagine.

I just didn't care about anyone or anything in this movie.
