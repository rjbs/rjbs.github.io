I realized that I forgot to mention a bunch of stuff from YAPC.  For one, I
partook of "Lunch with a Perl Celebrity" and had lunch with Tommy Stanton,
Andrew, Frew, and Geoff, followed by ice cream at the [Chocolate
Shoppe](http://www.chocolateshoppeicecream.com/), which was great.  I went
there twice, and I would've gone there again if I was a little weaker-willed.
I had some surprisingly good pizza from [Ian's](http://www.ianspizza.com/) with
Paul Fenwick.  Our D&D plans fell through, but that was okay because we hung
out in the lobby and talked to whoever was around.  I learned that the `-b`
switch is better than `-w` for whitespace-ignoring diffs in `git`, most of the
time.  I found out that Steffen was an exchange student in Connecticut for a
year and that Tom's Wisconsin experiences were even weirder than I'd known.  I
saw Breno talk about [Data::Printer](http://metacpan.org/module/Data::Printer),
which looked really useful, except for the ugly-to-me defaults.  I had a good
discussion about "eating blood" in various world cultures, but tried not to let
it run too long in deference to Dave Rolsky, who was sitting *right there*.  I
learned that the new big Unicode book is paperback and cheap (yay!) but not
purple (boo!).  I saw that [one of my modules](http://dzil.org/) got [its own
badge
ribbon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rjbs/7447996458/in/set-72157630298408298/),
which made me feel inordinantly pleased.  I got lunch at the Chicago airport at
the Billy Goat tavern, which is where "cheezborger cheezborger no coke, pepsi"
came from, more or less.  I ate about a zillion mocha mousse cups and did my
best to convince a few dieting people to try them too, despite their vows.
Sorry.  I got a few swag decks of cards from [The Game
Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/), my favorite of which has a Perl
Foundation-y onion on the reverse.  I accidentally slept through the Thursday
lightning talks.  I had a really good garlic and plantain empanada.  I saw two
talks about exceptions, in which
[Throwable](http://metacpan.org/module/Throwable) was mentioned, and felt like
I should probably go look much harder for bugs in it before more people use it.

I had fun!
