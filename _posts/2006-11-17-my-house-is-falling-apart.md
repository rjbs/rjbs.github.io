Today, the weather was crap.  It was extremely windy and rainy.  In the afternoon, I started to hear a weird noise coming from outside, like the kind of fake thunder you make by shaking a sheet of aluminum.  It turns out that the flashing from around the third floor roof came loose and was shaking around like crazy, barely dangling off the house.  Just as we came back from the grocery, it came off and fell to the ground.  There are now a few pieces of aluminum sitting on my rear porch.

I sure hope the roofers call to schedule their work soon.
