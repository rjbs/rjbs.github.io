Ugh.  A while ago, I wrote about the difficulties involved in [getting wasted
in Pennsylvania](http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1500).  Normally, it only
affects me as trivia.  The thrice-cursed monopoly's stores carry the brands
that I'm used to buying.  Their prices aren't intolerable.

This week, however, they have lost me forever.  As far as I'm concerned, the
PLCB needs to be busted.

Rye whiskey is a traditional style of American whiskey, and Pennsylvania used
to produce a lot of it before Prohibition.  Now it mostly comes from
bourbon-producing states, like Kentucky -- even labels that use Pennsylvanian
names and recipes, like Rittenhouse Rye.  Rittenhouse produces some of the
best-reviewed rye out there, and recently won awards at one show for being both
the best rye *and* the best value.

I really want a bottle of it.

The monopoly store didn't have any on the shelf.  In fact, they didn't have
*any* rye.  I went to the PLCB website and found that the only rye whiskey they
distribute normally is Jim Beam.  At first I couldn't find Rittenhouse at all,
because it was listed under "Rye (Bottled-In Bond)" rather than "Rye
(Straight)."  This is a pretty bizarre distinction, and I can't imagine that
none of the other ryes are bottled in bond.  They probably just don't make
noise about it.

Anyway, I found it, and their price is great: $12 a bottle.  The bad news is
that the only distributor they can get it from will only supply it by the case.
So, think about that: the PLCB has a monopoly on liquor sales in the state, and
they still can't offer me what I want because their hands are tied by some
distributor.

At this point, in a state that was not insane, I would go to another store, but
I can't.  They're all the same, here.  In a state that was not insane, I might
then try ordering a bottle online, but I can't do that in Pennsylvania.
Because of the PLCB, no one is allowed to sell booze to me over the internet --
except for the PLCB.  Not only do they not sell Rittenhouse Rye at their web
store, they don't sell *any* rye whiskey.

So, if I want to try a bottle of rye once made in my state, I need to either
buy a case, find people with whom to split a case, or drive to New Jersey and
buy it there.  I think that the only sane option -- going to Jersey -- might
actually be illegal.  I'm going to do it anyway.
