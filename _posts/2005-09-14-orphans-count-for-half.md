I had a weird dream last night.  I was writing test code for mailing list software -- which is what I've been doing at work -- and somehow found myself engaging in a game based on list subscribers.  It would have had to be a computer game, you'd think, but instead it was more like soccer.  You'd reach down into a manhole, pull out a subscriber, and position them.  There was a limit as to how many subscribers you could put on your side of the pitch. While setting up my side, I found out a weird little exception: orphan children counted for less than a full person, so you could really line the goal line with them.

I have no idea what is going on in my brain.
