The following is a dramatization.  The content has been changed to ridicule the annoying.

Tuesday morning:
<pre><code>	Dear Gandi:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>	I filed a request to have my nameservers changed on Thursday.It's Tuesday,
	and they still haven't been updated!This is very inconvenient.
</code></pre>

Tuesday evening:
<pre><code>	Dear Ricardo,
</code></pre>
<pre><code>	Actualluy, the site is online.
	After this kind of change, you need to wait for the propagation delay.
	This delay can last 48-72 hours.
</code></pre>

Wednesday morning:
<pre><code>	Dear Gandi:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>	It's been well over 72 hours, now.I don't know what you mean, but the DNS
	servers should be:
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li value="x">ns.manxome.org - 66.92.232.24</li>
<li value="y">ns.manxome.org - 67.18.176.115</li>
</ol>

Thursday morning:
<pre><code>	Dear Ricardo:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>	Actually, the servers for manxome.org are :
	Name Server:A.NS.MANXOME.ORG
	Name Server:B.NS.MANXOME.ORG
</code></pre>

Thursday afternoon:
<pre><code>	Dear Gandi:
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li value="Fine">The problem is that the IPs are wrong.  Your system has the correct</li>
<li value="ones">The TLD servers has the wrong ones.</li>
</ol>

Thursday afternoon, later:
<pre><code>	Dear Ricardo:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>	You have to update the IP on the registry.
	Please go to our administration page / Others Functions / Nameservers records
	at Registry
	And update your reccords. 
</code></pre>

...so, to update my records, I need to update /their/ records of my NS servers and IP, and I need to update /the TLD/ records of my NS servers and IP.  This is new.  It is stupid.  It is not documented.  It took way to long to be explained.

So, goodbye Gandi!  I registered at PairNIC this morning, and hope to be transferred quickly.  For reasonable (or better!) service, plus a friend at the company, six dollars more each year is a bargain.
