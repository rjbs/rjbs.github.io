I have two scary noises to report one.  One of them is the blather coming from the TV.  It's the final debate, and I wish we had politicians who were just a little frank.  I want the debate to be like a spelling bee: the candidate has to say the question before and after answering, to remind the audience what he should be answering.

The other one will affect my life more immediately.  I just put my new tube on my bike.  When I put the bike back on its feet, I gave the headshok a push, and it made an unpleasant grinding noise.  It would be nice if it was better in the morning, but I think I'll have to call Genesis and see what I can do.  Ugh!
