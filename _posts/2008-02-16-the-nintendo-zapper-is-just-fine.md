For St. Valentine's Day, Gloria gave me a [Nintendo
Zapper](http://www.amazon.com/Wii-Zapper-Links-Crossbow-Training/dp/B000W5Y49G),
which is basically a two-handed Wii remote holder that acts like a combination
light gun and thumbstick.  It comes with a little demo game called Link's
Crossbow Training, in which Link shoots targets, kills monsters, and runs
gauntlets.  Last night, John C. asked me, "But what else would you play with
that?"

Well, probably nothing else.  If I was going to play House of the Dead, or
Umbrella Chronicles, I'd probably want the one-handed [Perfect
Shot](http://www.amazon.com/Nyko-87030-Wii-Perfect-Shot/dp/B000X2RKOO).  That's
not the point, though!  Crossbow Training is a lot of fun, even if I only play
it for a few hours total.  It certainly seems like it's worth $20.  Once I
finish it with the Zapper, I might try it without the Zapper.

Either way, though, it's a fun game for $20, and if I ever use the Zapper
again, that will just be a bonus.
