Wow.

> years as well as Apache via Mod_Perl), 10 plus year open source Linux

> My syntactical manipulative abilities in Perl (both structured and
> object based),  HTML,  JavaScript, and Python as well as highly
> advanced database design & optimization skill-set (once debugging
> twenty-five advanced finance database student applications in a twenty
> minute time-frame), enables me to logically code 3,000 to 4,000 lines
> of code, per month (this translates into the work of two, possibly
> three programmers) in the design of software and Internet-based
> solutions.   If this is your first experience, during this canvass,
