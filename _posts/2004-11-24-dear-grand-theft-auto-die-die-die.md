I want to RELAX on my vacation.  Sometimes, I relax by playing video games. Even if I get frustrated, they are usually fun.  GTA:SA is not being fun, right now.

I am on the "flying school" missions.  I have to complete ten flying tests, which are not fun.  They are difficult, and I know that I am not going to need many of the skills they are trying to give me.  Meanwhile, all my other available missions are locked off.  I can't do more missions for other people until these are done... except for the RC Zero mission with the miniature planes, which also sucks.  I finally had to stop playing, because I didn't want to destroy my controller.

I guess it's time to do some coding.
