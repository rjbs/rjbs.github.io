<h4>work</h4>Today was a good work day.  I put aside the things I'd been working on, because they were going nowhere, and picked up an ancient initiative I had to fix part of our intensely annoying production database.  I spent a third of my day walking around the building getting engineers to agree to things and a third mocking up the things to which they were agreeing.  (The remaining third was spent on trivia.)

By the end of the day, I'd cobbled together a simple summary document that can replace one of our hugely complex, balkanized document sets.  It means that I can de-balkanize the database front-end, which means a much easier time of maintaining things.  This could be a good major first step toward getting this database into such a shape that it can actually be fixed and, eventually, extended.<h4>animal crossing</h4>I picked up Animal Crossing for keeps, today.  I was tempted to pick up the e-Reader, too, but that's money that can go toward The Camera Fund!  I played just a bit, and found out that my bill for the addition of a basement was pretty reasonable.  Unfortunately, the next rennovation ("something more major," Tom said) is having my roof painted.  WTF!

Nothing exciting went on in town, although there's <em>another</em> new animal, Teddy the bear.  I gave all the men in town spade shirts, and Teddy moved in wearing a club shirt.  I figure it's time to organize a gang war.
