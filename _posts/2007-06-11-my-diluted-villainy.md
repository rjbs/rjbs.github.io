Tonight, we (mostly I) watched The African Queen, one of the three movies left
on the AFI Top 100 movies that I haven't seen.  It's set during WWI.  In one
scene, Bogart and Hepburn are to be hanged by a German naval captain.  Bogart
asks the captain to wed him to Hepburn before they are executed, and the
captain agrees.

    <rjbs> I'd feel like a jerk, marrying a couple just before hanging them.
    <gloria> Well, you're only 50% German.
