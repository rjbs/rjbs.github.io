I supplied points to people using it in the wild, which could be looked
at for use cases.  Then...

Sometimes, I don't get it.  Am I the jerk, here?  Wouldn't it have been
a lot easier for me to *not* release code, or to *not* ever respond to
support requests, or to *not* think about code outside of office hours?
I have a perfectly good XBox 360 collecting dust because I write code to
*give away* in my free time.

Is it too much to ask that people don't call me a jackass for not
wanting to work on *their bug* right away?  I mean, I can offer my rate
card for those who really care!

I think today I will play some Civilization or BioShock.
