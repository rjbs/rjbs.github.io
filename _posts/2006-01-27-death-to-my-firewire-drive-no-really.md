I usually carry a little 40GB LaCie "Porsche" drive with me.  I keep some random stuff on it, mostly movies that I got from Netflix and want to have on a lower power-consumption format to watch on the bus.

On Monday evening, I got a bunch of good music to listen to from Bryan, and the next day I got some albums I wanted to borrow from Louis.  I was very excited to get home and listen to a bunch of the things I hadn't heard in forever.

Once I got home, though, I found that the drive wouldn't mount.  Apparently between work and getting home, something horrible happened to my drive.  fsck won't repair it.  I have no idea what else I can do.

I want my KRS-ONE!  I MUST LEARN!
