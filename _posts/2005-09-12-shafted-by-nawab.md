We went out to dinner with my parents tonight.  We went to Nawab, the local Indian place.  They had coupons for two-for-one entrees, which said, "Cannot be combined with other coupons.  One coupon per person per visit."  The waitress would only take one coupon, though, saying that the "cannot be combined" meant that only one coupone could be used for the entire party of four.  This totally blew.  My mom was treating, so she got stuck for an extra twelve bucks or so.

The food was really good, at least.
