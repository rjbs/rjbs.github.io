I just recently [wrote about trying to deal with my backlog of bug reports and
feature requests](http://rjbs.manxome.org/rubric/entry/1996).  It is not, sad
to say, the only backlog of stuff I've been meaning, but failing, to do.
There's also my backlog of reading.

*(and that's only the physical books)*

I need to get through these!  Lately, I'm only getting any reading done on
new books, and I'm buying a lot of new books.  Also, my birthday is coming up
soon, and my [wishlist](/wishlist) is full of books.  I don't want to stop
wishing for booksâ€¦ I just want to feel like I have a plan to *read* the books I
*get*!

Too often, I started reading a book, then put it aside to read something else,
then never get back to the thing I was reading to start with.  No more!  Or, at
least, not as often anymore!  I don't mind giving up on a book, or even saying,
explicitly, that I'll try again in a year.  I just don't like the idea that I'm
putting books aside "for a little while" and then never getting back to them.
Perhaps ironically, the book with which I've done this the most often is The
Magic Mountain, which I've been reading off and on since 1997.  For that book,
I think it is a good plan.  For almost any other book I've been trying to read,
not so much.

So, the new plan is this:  I keep big list of all the books I'm really meaning
to read.  This doesn't mean everything I own but haven't read.  It's all the
stuff I've asked for or purchased in order to read "soon."  It's not a queue,
either, because I'll pick what to read as I go.  Who wants to pick, a year in
advance, what book to read around Christmas 2014?  Not me, man.  Not me.

I categorized each book in the list as either fiction, humanities, or
technical.  (I was sorely tempted to replace "technical" with "quadrivium" just
to keep the tables nicely aligned without spaces, but I resisted.)  I will work
on no more than one book of each category at a time.  When I finish one, I
won't pick its replacement until I feel like it.  Once I will either finish
reading the replacement or clearly decide to either give up on it or put it
away for a good long while, while I read something else.

To start, I picked the most recent story collection I was working on, a nice
short technical book, and a thick and difficult book of history that I was
really, really enjoying (in a way) when I was making real progress in it.

     Literature: Moon Moth and Other Stories, The
     Technical : Starting Forth
     Humanities: Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

I have no idae whether this plan will work, but I feel like it's better than
continuing along the random non-plan that I've been following.  I put [the big
list of book](https://github.com/rjbs/misc/blob/master/reading.mkdn) on GitHub
along with my previous big list of software libraries.  Hopefully keeping them
in one place will help me tie them together as "things to keep updated" in my
head.
