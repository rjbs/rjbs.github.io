I didn't really know who this [Vincent Pit](http://search.cpan.org/~vpit/)
character was until a couple years ago when Variable::Magic showed up.  It was
pretty cool, and then I'd see him saying crazy cool things on the
[p5p](http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?perl5_porters) IRC channel.
At some point I said, "Hey, Vincent.  I bet you're just the guy to convince to
make it possible to localize something in a higher scope."

He smiled, nodded, and said, "Uh huh."  Then as soon as I forget mentioning it
to him, he sent me a link to a tarball.  Now it's powering some [really cool
dists](http://cpants.perl.org/dist/used_by/Scope-Upper) on the CPAN!

A few months later, I said, "You really kicked ass with Scope::Upper.  You know
what else would be cool?"  Again, some silence, followed by a [really sweet
implementation](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lexical-Types/lib/Lexical/Types.pm).

Vincent, you confound me!  On one hand, I want to learn much more about the
guts of perl5 so I can do such awesome things.  On the other hand, you keep
doing them as soon as I have conceived of them, so I have no need.

I think I'll just go with the flow and learn nothing, so I can spend my minimal
remaining free time [stomping
necromorphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_%28video_game%29).
