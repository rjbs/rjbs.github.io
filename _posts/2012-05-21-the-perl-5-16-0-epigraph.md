It is traditional for each release of `perl` to be announced with a form letter
beginning with a quote, or epigraph, chosen by the release engineer.  For Perl
5.16.0, I chose the penultimate stanza from W.H. Auden's [September 1,
1939](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_1,_1939).

The [full text of the
poem](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=september+1%2C+1939+auden) can be found easily
by searching, though I may not reproduce it in its entirety here.

It was written shortly after the outbreak of WWII, and reflects on what a
bloody mess everything was, is, and would be.  Specifically, it's about the
feelings among the crowd of men around the poet: the quiet desperation that
dominates their lives, now as ever before.  Not just because of impending
chaos, but because of the struggle that will continue against it now as it did
before: to live honestly, to be happy, and to be loved.

> For the error bred in the bone  
> Of each woman and each man  
> Craves what it cannot have,  
> Not universal love  
> But to be loved alone.

The Internet is a weird and terrible thing.  Larry wrote, "The social dynamics
of the net are a direct consequence of the fact that nobody has yet developed a
Remote Strangulation Protocol."  It's true.  They're also a consequence of the
fact that many of the protocols that do exist are used largely to function as a
remote abuse protocol.  It's very easy to abuse someone over email or IRC or
blog posts.

Over the last nine months, I've gone from reading *lots* of the Perl 5 Porters
mailing list to reading *all* of it, even when it grows distasteful, and let me
tell you something:  it sucks.

To be fair, it's much better than it once was.  Even I, relative latecomer,
remember some of the dark days when everything was a flame war.  Compared to
then, the list now is civil discourse.  Compared to actual civil discourse,
though, things are not great.

I see at least two causes.  The first is that when someone without much proven
technical work in his or her portfolio posts abuse, it's considered okay to
abuse in return.  This is the "well, he started it" defense, and too often it's
considered a valid one.  The other cause is that we don't call out the
technically useful members of our community for bad behavior, because they're
useful.  This is the rockstar problem.  These two problems work together, of
course.  When a new poster abuses an existing member and the existing member
responds in high dudgeon, everyone thinks this is right and proper.

It makes me think back to a lightning talk at OSCON 2011, when someone said,
"When we say that this community requires a thick skin, it means we're
self-selecting for only people with thick skin."  It also means that we're
doomed to cycle back into nastiness as the group's average skin thickness and
willingness to flame grows higher and higher.

> The enlightenment driven away,  
> The habit-forming pain,  
> Mismanagement and grief:  
> We must suffer them all again.

Of course, this problem is everywhere on the Internet.  It's in every
language's development community.  We are not even close to free software's
most wretched hive of scum and villainy.  That's because, people say, free
software is a meritocracy where the best contributors will be respected and
last.  Heck, that's why they're allowed to be abusive.

The thing is, it means that the best *abusive* workers will flourish, not just
the best.  When the culture around a project becomes too caustic, there are
plenty of useful people who will leave (or decline to join) exactly because of
the culture where the outsider is free to be abused.  There is no real
meritocracy there.

> Where blind skyscrapers use  
> Their full height to proclaim  
> The strength of Collective Man,  
> Each language pours its vain  
> Competitive excuse:  
> But who can live for long  
> In an euphoric dream;

Larry talked about troll-hugging at YAPC last year, and how the correct
response to abuse is not more abuse.  The correct response to abuse is
patience, correction, explanation, and an outpouring of civilly-worded
disapproval.  These are expressions of love, whereby we try to improve our
attacker so that we won't need to attack each other any more.

This was my release epigraph for Perl 5.16.0:

> All I have is a voice  
> To undo the folded lie,  
> The romantic lie in the brain  
> Of the sensual man-in-the-street  
> And the lie of Authority  
> Whose buildings grope the sky:  
> There is no such thing as the State  
> And no one exists alone;  
> Hunger allows no choice  
> To the citizen or the police;  
> We must love one another or die.

> â€“ W.H. Auden, September 1, 1939
