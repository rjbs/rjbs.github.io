<h4>monkey ball</h4>I played some more Monkey Ball today, getting my point balance up to 1200 or so.  Utterly exhausted with Challenge mode (and stuck in Story mode), I said, "Gloria, it's time for you to play Monkey Ball.  It is your <strong>duty</strong>."

And she did!

She actually got further in Story mode than I've gotten, which was mildly humbling.  She went from nervous to ass-kicking very quickly)!  After about two hours, she'd racked up over 1600 points!  We unlocked Monkey Boat, which was really weird and not immediately much fun.  I'm hoping that, with a little time, it'll become easier to play and therefore enjoy.

I'm hoping this marks the beginning of a good enjoyment (read: mild addiction) of MB2 on Gloria's part.  Who couldn't use more Monkey Balls in his (her) life?
