So, in old-school D&D – prior to AD&D Second Edition – every class had a
different title at each level until "name level," which was always 9th
level.  Some of these made more sense than others.  If the priesthood
controls your access to your priestly powers, maybe there really are
well-known titles for different ranks.  Others are sillier: when a thief
reaches 7th level, he's still just "pilfering?"

There are two kinds of things that bug me about these class titles.
First, some of them are too specific.  Why is my 3rd level fighter, who
uses a club, a "swordmaster?"  Why is my straight-arrow 8th level
magic-user a "necromancer?"

Second, the non-human class titles stink.  They're just the human ones
recycled, which is a much sadder thing than level caps.

I think level titles are fun.  I especially like that they give everyone
a ready-made epithet, and that by replacing the stock epithet with a
cooler one, you can reward a character.  Even at level one, Mero the
Halfling clearly earned "Mero the Deadly," which will remain cooler at
every level than whatever the stock epithet might be.  If I didn't want
to futz with having these tables, I would still like giving everyone an
epithet and cranking up its awesomeness as they level up.

I also think I will want to tweak level titles for each campaign I run,
and probably have several progressions within that.  Like, clerics of
the Army of Saints will end up with different titles than clerics of
Thrul Victorious.  I'm just going to have a first go at better titles
for my [*Beyond the Temple of the
Abyss*](http://dudgeonmaster.org/games/beyond/) campaign.

### Table Support!

I added [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) support to
[Rubric](https://metacpan.org/release/Rubric) just for this post.  Isn't that
exciting?
