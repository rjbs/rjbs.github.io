I mis-read the iSync supported devices page.  Oops.  My Samsung SGH-D807 is not a supported phone, meaning that I can't easily keep it in sync with my Mac's calendar and address book.  It's fairly easy to delete all the contacts on my phone, then import all the vCards from my Address Book.  I would go so far, in fact, as to say that I don't mind the hassle.  iSync was nicer, but it's something I only do once in a while.

I'll more sorely miss the ability to sync my calendar.  It was really nice to be able to glance at my RAZR and see what my plans were for the coming week. This seems like it's just right out with the Samsung.  Argh!

I will probably end up getting yet another new phone in July, when my T-Mobile contract expires.  Until then, I'll probably just try to grin and bear the Samsung.  I read a claim by some random guy on the internet that Mac OS 10.5 supports syncing to this phone, but I have not yet been able to substantiate it.  I think it will turn out to be untrue.
