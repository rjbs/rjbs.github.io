I just finished watching the first season of Jericho, this week.  It has made me think that I should turn my cistern into a shelter and stock up on weapons. I thought, "maybe it's time to get that Yugo SKS that I've been thinking about."

Then I thought, "Well, I should see what the experts have to say about this kind of preparation," so I searched Google for "accurate rifle apocalypse." The first result was a page called "PREPARING FOR THE APOCALYPSE" and suggesting the Yugo SKS.
