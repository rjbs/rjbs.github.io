I just had the weirdest experience.

I often sit cross-legged, and I was doing so as I read my morning news, replied to some email, and looked over the overnight reports from work.  When it was getting close to time to go, I got up to go take a shower and realized that both of my legs had fallen asleep.  This wasn't the sort of pins and needle sleep that makes it uncomfortable to walk: they were both completely unresponsive to my mind's commands.  (I have no idea how I managed to stand up.)  I took one or two faltering steps, swinging my dead legs and assuming they'd quickly get to work, but then I realized that this was not going to happen, and that I had no chance to get back to the sofa.

I tried to lean on something or turn around, but it was no use.  I fell backwards onto the coffee table and sat on my laptop.

Fortunately, it was not broken!  It turned off, for some reason, but that's OK. It turned back on with no problem.  The lid still stays in place, and there are no horrible noises coming from it.

It was pretty scary for about five seconds there, though.
