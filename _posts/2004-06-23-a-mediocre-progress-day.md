Work was so-so, today.  I poked a few projects with sticks, making some progress on one or two.  I moved all our web applications to a newer server, exposing a number of internal distributions that really need proper Makefiles and prerequisite lists.  I told my boss that it would be really convenient to make the use of CPAN.pm easier.  PPM is the pits.

Tomorrow I need to get a bunch of abandonware working to power our SPC, and then I need to write a screen scraper to harvest our stock price.  I don't think Finance::Quote or any of the other modules will work with the London Exchange---but I'll find out.

After work, I came home and dozed.  I was pretty tired, for no very good reason.  I played a little FM4, ate some dinner, and stared at a little code. Gloria and I ran by my parents, and I saw that my father had picked up books three and four in the Series of Unfortunate Events.  I guess he liked books one and two, which I gave him for his birthday and Father's Day.  Woo!

We got some ice cream on the way home, and then watched Sunset Boulevard, which was a good, but weird, old movie.  I'm not sure what it had to say, if anything.  Still, I'm glad I've finally seen it.  While we watched that, I worked on some little code things I wanted to get done.  First off, Acme::ProgressBar, which I released.  It's stupid, but it makes me smile.

Then I updated my little journal-entry-posting script, so it should now post relevant entries automatically to use.perl.org; I'll find that out shortly!

I really wanted to get a document together, tonight, to describe how to test a Wafl block module for Kwiki.  That would've required learning how, though, and I just didn't think I had the time, once I got to working.  Maybe tomorrow. I'd like to start on Vim for Vim Users in earnest, though.

My IntroComp entry needs to be put together!  The time is approaching rapidly!
