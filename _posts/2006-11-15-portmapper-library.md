One of the Coding Monkeys pointed this site's sample program out to me as a way to temporarily NAT map a port on my Airport to my laptop.  I just run "portmap -a 6942" and I get that port for a while, which means I can host a SubEtha session.  Awesome!

I've been meaning to write this advice down for about 9 months now.
