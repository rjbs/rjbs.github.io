Horror Movie Month 2012 is done!  Thirty-one movies in thirty-one days!  (We
missed one day but watched two on another.)

I think this year's crop was much better than last year's, although Gloria
doesn't seem convinced.  Of the batch, I'd only recommend a few:

* Stake Land was nothing special, but I'm a sucker for post-apocalypse.
* Brain Damage was a weird exploitation movie that I really enjoyed for no very clear reason.  It was made by the maker of the Basket Case movies, which I also liked.
* The Stepfather wasn't great, but I liked Terry O'Quinn — and why wouldn't I?
* Phase 7 was enjoyable, mostly because the protagonist was such a normal schmoe.
* Apollo 18 had its merits, and I enjoyed it, but it really didn't buy into its own "found footage" conceit.
* Murder Party was almost certainly the best of the bunch.  It was pure fun.
* Silent Hill: Revelation was good, if you like that sort of thing.  I do.
* Doghouse was fun, too, but made me think of Shaun of the Dead too often.

I think the worst of show goes to Transylvania 6-5000.  Ugh.
