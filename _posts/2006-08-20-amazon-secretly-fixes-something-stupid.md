I often get irritated with things on Amazon.  Sometimes, I send an email about my complaints.  Usually, I get an automated or otherwise not-very-promising reply.  Then, the problem gets fixed after a year or two.  The weird thing is that the things that bug me that get fixed never get the kind of fanfare that new features I don't like get.  Those giant video clips kept getting in my way, the animated shaking gold box made me want to smack somebody, and so on.

Meanwhile, today I noticed that I can now tell Amazon that I do not want to have my recommendations based on certain purchases.  I was getting yoga suggestions because of books I bought for Gloria.  Today, I saw that I could uncheck "use for recommendations" on that product.  This might make their recommendations useful again!  That's dangerous, I might want to buy more stuff...
