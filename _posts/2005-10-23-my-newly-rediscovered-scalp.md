I've needed a haircut for a while, but it hasn't been convenient to go see my barber, so I shaved my head.  It's been a long time since I last did that -- maybe a year or so.  This was the second or third time that I've shaved my head with just scissors and a safety razor, as I have no working buzzers.  This is a very annoying process, and I will definitely get buzzers again for the next time.  I just need to get good ones that don't cease functioning after a few uses.

On shaving my head I found three little off-color spots on my scalp.  This is mildly disconcerting, but I'm hoping that some sunlight makes my head become normal again.

Not having hair is really convenient.
