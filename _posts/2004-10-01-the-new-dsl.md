My new DSL modem was waiting for me when I got home.  I plugged it in, but the loop wasn't active yet.  We sat around for a while and watched some TV, but I kept looking over to see whether the DSL light came on.  It didn't, though, and after a while we went out and got some pie.  On returning home, the light was on and a little investigation showed about 4Mbps down and 600Kbps up.  Nice!

I did some rewiring, rerouting, and reorganizing this morning.  Apart from the propagation of NS records for manxome.org, everything seems pretty good now. The biggest problem is the Airport, which wants to be the DNS server, but seems to crap out now and then.  With the Speakeasy DNS server IP's put in place, things work fine.  Sadly, I don't see a simple way to tell the Airport to not try to do everything on its own.  I'm googling now, mostly because I don't want to have to /do/ anything when changing networks.  DHCP should be enough.

I'm hoping that DNS will be all rolled over tonight or tomorrow, and I'll be able to see what it looks like to browse my images remotely.
