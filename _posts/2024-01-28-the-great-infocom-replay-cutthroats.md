I guess feel a *little* sheepish that I'm not really going to play much
Cutthroats.  Maybe it's some kind of shame at quitting early that made me stop
the replay ages ago.  This is silly, though.  I don't think the game is fun,
and I don't really want to force myself to sit through it.

I considered using a walkthrough to get some of the later bits.  I'm told the
sea diving is cool.  I just don't find it appealing to bother.

Things to note:

It's got hunger and thirst timers, ugh.

There lots of rooms with the same name.  This isn't that uncommon, but the
east-west "Wharf Road" is five rooms all called Wharf Road.  It can be a drag.

The game has some in-game time events.  That is:  You get told "come to a
meeting at this place at 9:30".  This felt really promising!  It's used to
enormous effect in Majora's Mask, although I knew it wouldn't be that good.
It's also part of the structure of Berlyn's earlier *Suspended*, where certain
events will happen at certain turns.  In the end, though, it was extremely
tedious.  I felt like I had four stand-up meetings, each of which ended with,
"Now meet me again thirty minutes from now.  The location of that meeting will
take twenty-three minutes to get to, so you'll be bored for seven minutes, but
you can't get anything useful done in that time either."  Bah.

On the *other* hand, there's a bit of a gotcha where your watch needs to be
wound or it'll stop early in the game, making it easy to miss appointments.  I
really liked that.

To assuage your hunger, you can "buy food" at a restaurant where one of those
meetings happens.  You're told you buy "a meal".  So much for the evocative
economy of Infocom writing!

Next up is [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(video_game))!
I've played it before, and I know what I'm in for.  I'll see how far I can get,
but as I recall, it's got great bits and also bits that are very tedious.
After that comes *Suspect*.  I'm not enthusiastic.  I guess I'm sounding a bit
like a sourpuss, but so it goes!
