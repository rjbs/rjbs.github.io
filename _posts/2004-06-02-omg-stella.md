In late 2002, when hanging out with Matt and Rahm, Cardiff co-workers, I was told that Stella Artois messes you up faster than other beers, and for know clear reason.  This is so true.  I've had two pints tonight, and I feel like I've had four bourbons.

So, I won't be long, here.  Godfrey and I hit La Fosse, and it was delicious. We had some calimari, which were alright, and a "rack of new season Welsh lamb," which was just great.  Godfrey's lamb was a bit rarer than he had wanted, but mine was just as I'd wanted, and it was quite tasty.  The flavor was mild but quite good.  I also imbibed the two aforementioned pints.

We're about to play a bit of ... well, something.  Empire Earth, maybe.  After that, bed.
