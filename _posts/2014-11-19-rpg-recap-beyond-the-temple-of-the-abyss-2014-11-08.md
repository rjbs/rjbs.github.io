## Thursday, 2nd day of the Frost Moon, 937

After spending the night off the road, the party headed into the elven woods.
They moved slowly, for a few hours, through the narrow road as it faded into a
path and branched in several directions.  In the canopy, giant spiders and
other things leapt from tree to tree, ignoring the party.

Another small party, made up of wary insectoid creatures carrying lavender
lanterns, passed them slowly by, pausing only to attempt to negotiate the
purchase of Oresta.  The party declined as best it could, lacking any common
tongue.

After some time, they came to a clearing and, investigating, found a number of
flat surfaces along the treeline.  In one, they found a door, which Knash
carefully prised open.  The door led to a small room, in which was a small
collection of overgrown rotten furniture, including a chair with an overgrown
corpse.  As the gang raided the room (finding a few weird coins, a pistol, and
some bullets), the corpse tore itself from its chair and rushed outside, where
it keened loudly, calling to the rest of its kind, similarly sealed up in the
trees.

The party fought against the plant men, slowly losing ground.  Perrin was badly
injured and a vine dragged him toward the cabin.  Hoyte was fatally injured,
but fought on, making a desperate last stand.  Finally, Knash uncased and read
one of his scrolls: *Imperial War Horror!*  Instantly transformed into
monstrous form, he tore through the remaining plant men, rending them limb from
limb and scattering their leaves to the wind.  In the end, everyone — save for
Hoyte — seemed sure to make it.

"Once he's dead," someone said, "let's check his pockets and get his wages
back."
