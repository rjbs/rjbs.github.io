You defaced the ABE.pm wiki yet again, removing information useful only to a handful of people.  You bypassed the security, which consists of requiring that users have internet connections, and hacked the software by creating a page called "DaRkNeSs" containin the line "HACKED BY DARKNESS" repeated 43 times.

Wiki Hacker, I salute you.
