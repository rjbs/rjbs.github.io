Just a note to myself, since I always forget: this is the order of the Fletch
books by Gregory McDonald:

1. Fletch Won (1985)
2. Fletch Too (1986)
3. Fletch & the Widow Bradley (1981)
4. Fletch (1974)
5. Carioca Fletch (1984)
6. Confess Fletch (1976)
7. Fletch's Fortune (1978)
8. Fletch's Moxie (1982)
9. Fletch and the Man Who (1983)
10. Son of Fletch (1993)
11. Fletch Reflected (1994)

I've read the first four.  I started to read the fourth one again today, by
mistake.
