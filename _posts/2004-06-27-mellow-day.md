I got up early today and went to the gym with Gloria.  I haven't been there in about two weeks, so I was happy to do an hour worth of cardio stuff.  Tomorrow maybe I'll try to bike for an hour or so.

I had gotten this weird craving for roast beef and horseradish, but I was pretty sure they wouldn't have that at the local bagel place.  They did!  I had a tasty bagel for breakfast, and it was good.  We went up to the Hedgehog and got some milkshakes, which were also good.  Then we came home, watched a three-part Farscape episode, and just relaxed and enjoyed ourselves.  We took a nap, then had dinner.  Then, after some more relaxing, we decided the time was ripe for cake and pie.  We swung by Golden Gate, and I had an excellent slice of marble cake.

I accomplished very little today, but it was a good day!

As for my accomplishments: I beat a mission of FM4, but then got stuck on the next one.  I wrote a few more tests for Parse::IRCLog and did a little research to find existing code that does the same thing.  I read a chapter of Code Complete, which is not, so far, very interesting.  I'm on chapter three and it still feels like I'm in the introduction.  More and more I like the O'Reilly Pocket Guides.  I imagine I'll really like Code Complete once I get into the meat of it.  Everyone else does.

Then again, most everyone really likes Perl Medic, but I found it only "good." I took it in to work to suggest to the engineer who's being crashed into Perl via maintenance programming.  I really enjoy teaching Perl.  I need to see what ever happened to that apprenticeship project.  I wouldn't mind learning more <em>or</em> teaching it.  Or both!
