I thought I'd posted these already, but it was brought to my attention that I
only sent them to the YAPC list.

I gave two fifty-minute talks at YAPC in Houston this year.  The first was
[Crafting Custom Interfaces with Sub::Exporter](http://www.slideshare.net/rjbs/crafting-custom-interfaces-with-subexporter/).
The other was [How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Email::: the 2007 PEP
Talk!!!](http://www.slideshare.net/rjbs/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-email-the-2007-pep-talk/).

I've uploaded my slides to Slidshare, as you can see.  It's not great, but it's
easy and adequate.  Both of those talks are greatly diminished without
narration, not only because you don't get to hear my sonorous baritone, but
because much of the explanation of the slides is strictly narrated, not
displayed.  Still, it's something.
