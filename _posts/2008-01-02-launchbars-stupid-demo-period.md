[hide](http://blogs.sackheads.org/hide/) recently told me that he'd moved from
Quicksilver to LaunchBar.  I try to do whatever the Canadians do, since I hear
they will soon be our new overlords.  I figured I'd do what I do with most
commercial software:  download it and use it during its trial period until it
became clear that it was worth the money, or until I was so irritated at it
that I had to stop.

The LaunchBar demo period is seven searches.  *Seven searches*.  I didn't
realize this, at first.  I was surprised to see that it uses the same default
keybinding as Spotlight, but I changed it to use the binding from Quicksilver.
I opened two or three things and thought that it seemed much faster, and that
it might be worth $20 if it ended up being faster and more stable than
Quicksilver.  I looked for how to use non-default actions, like "add this track
to play next in Party Shuffle."  While doing that, I was told that I needed to
restart LaunchBar.  I couldn't even use it for a day to make up my mind,
because I'd constantly be restarting it.

I guess they saved me $20.
