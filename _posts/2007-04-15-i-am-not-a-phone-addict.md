John C. has been giving me a very slightly hard time about my new phone habit.
Honestly, I hate getting new phones, and I wish I could just get one that would
last until it fell apart.  Then I would re-buy the same model and use that.  If
possible, I'd buy in bulk.  This is what I do with shoes.

The problem is that the US is so amazingly far behind the rest of the world in
deploying Awesome Cell Phone Technology that I always know that my phone is
obsolete when I buy it and that I will be able to replace it with an obsolete
state of the art phone in a few years.

About a year ago, I bought a Nokie 6620.  It's what John had, and I knew I
could use it as a Bluetooth modem to get online with T-Mobile.  Two months
later, it went missing and I got a RAZR v3 to replace it.  It was one of the
only decent GPRS phones I could get from T-Mobile, especially if I wanted to be
sure I could use it as a modem.  Lately, I've been getting more and more
frustrated with the terrible speeds I get over GPRS.  I get about 40Kbps, which
is good for basic GPRS, but still dreadful.  The latency is about one second.
The only thing whose speed I don't notice is the delivery of mail out of my
Postfix queue.

I'd really like to get a faster phone.  In most of the world, I'd be getting
HSDPA.  It can get up to ridiculously fast speeds, starting at 1.8Mbps.  Of
course, T-Mobile doesn't support HSDPA, and doesn't sell any phones that
support it.  I thought about buying a RAZR v3xx, but I'd have to buy it on the
open market.  For a non-telco-locked phone in the US, that basically means the
grey market.  On eBay, it looked like it was going to run me about $300 to get
one, which was just too much.  It would've left me ready when HSDPA hits
T-Mobile, but... who knows when or if that will happen.

Finally, I called up T-Mobile and I told them that I wanted a phone that had
Bluetooth and EDGE.  As usual, they were really helpful, even though the rep
had to put me on hold a couple times to find out what the hell I was talking
about.  Sometime this week, I should receive a new Nokia 6103.  If I can get it
working at a modem, I'm keeping it.  Otherwise I'm sending it back and getting
another new phone.

If that phone doesn't work, I'll get *another* new phone.

I can quit, though, anytime that I want.
