Gloria decided, today, that I am so awesome that I deserve an early birthday present.  Who can argue with that kind of reasoning?

She gave me a DS Lite, which I turned on and oohed and aahed at.  It came with zero games, though, so she also consented to give me a lift to Game Crazy, where I picked up Meteos and Mario and Luigi.  Later on, we hit the mall and I picked up the New Super Mario Bros.  All of the games seem pretty boss.

I've added some other games to my wish list, but I'm in no hurry.  It'll take me plenty of time to work my way through these three.  Also, I should really update Games::Nintendo::Mario with more games, soon... well, after I'm done getting through the queue of PEP bugs.
