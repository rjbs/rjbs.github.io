<h4>animal crossing</h4>I played some more AX this morning.  I'm getting the impression that late night and early morning aren't going to be ideal times for the game.  Last night, once I finished my chores, Tom Nook closed his shop immediately, and the animals started going to bed.  This morning, only Goose was up.  A few other animals were sleeping outside, but they all went in when I woke them up.  Goose asked me to go pick up his camera from Camofrog, but Camo was asleep!

I tried going to Isle Iszlburg, but I'm not sure I understand how to use the island.  I got a Hawaiian shirt and some coconuts, at least.  I'll try planting a coconut tree, once I can get a shovel.  Kapp'n might be my favorite character so far.

He's cool.

There's a weird, glowing dig-spot near the beach, and I'm eager to dig it up and see what's in there.
