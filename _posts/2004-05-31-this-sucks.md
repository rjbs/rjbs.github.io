I'm at work, in the UK office.  I am the only IT person here.  I'm the only IT person in either office: it's Memorial Day in the states and the spring bank holiday here.  There are non-IT people here, but none of the people I need to talk to.  I'm trying to do work things, but it's so hard to concentrate.  If I was in the US, I'd be asleep.  Later, I'd be eating something suitably Memorial Day-a-licious, like corn and hot dogs.  And I'd be hanging out with Gloria, relaxing on the sofa, possibly watching Farscape or Good Eats or something.

I bet Good Eats is going to have some good episodes airing, related to picnic foods.  Oh!  Gloria and I could get Chinese and go eat it picnic-style on Sand Island or something.

I better take a make-up Memorial day on my return.
