Very late in 2004, I made a list of things to do in 2005.  Basically, my new year's resolutions.  Let's review, shall we?

* only watch TV if I planned to see what's on

This went pretty well at first.  I got pretty good at avoiding the TV.  Then I got a TiVo, and I started watching huge amounts of Law and Order.  I've certainly backed off since then, but now I'm watching too many suggestions.  I need to cut back on things like King of the Hill and South Park.

So, this one was a qualified success, but will remain an area for improvement.

* write more prose and/or poetry

I didn't even try to do Nanowrimo, this year.  I have done a lot of writing-like work with the RPG I'm running.  I think I may just eliminate this goal, in the future, and maybe replace it with something like "do more letter-writing."

* learn enough Obj-C to write a Cocoa application

Ha!  No, this didn't happen.  I'd still like to learn to work on Cocoa, but it's just not very urgent.  Maybe if I had something specific I wanted to do, and I had a real need for it.  As it stands, this looks like a loser.

* keep a record of every book I read (and read more of them)

I'm not sure how I did, compared to last year, because I had no record of last year's reading.  I did start keeping a record, and frankly I'm disappointed in myself.  I need to up my pace and really plow through more books that I'm currently picking at.  If I replaced every hour of stupid TV watching with an hour of reading, I'd make some serious progress.

I'll take half credit on this one.

* go have a beer with a friend more often

I definitely did this more, this year, than last.  Still, not much.  I just need more local friends who actually have time to grab a beer now and then!

* get better at maintaining my own bicycle

Finally, a serious win!  I took a bike maintenance course at the Bethlehem Bicycle Co-operative, and it was loads of fun.  I got a certificate from the Park Tool School program, I took apart most of my bike and put it back together, I got a bike stand, and for Christmas I got a number of the tools I need.

Once the winter is over, I will try to do more riding and repairing!

* enroll in a Spanish course (if possible)

Again, I did it!  I took Spanish I and II, and I feel alright about how much I learned in just thirty hours or so.  I need to find a way to put my Spanish into use, though.  If nothing else, I should get my dad to speak more Spanish with me.  It's so very, very easy to be lazy about using a foreign language when you already share your native language with people.  I could speak German or Spanish with my parents, but they both speak English, so es dificil por mi no hablar ingles.

* learn to drive a car

Er, whoops.  My learner's permit expired, and I didn't renew it.  I really will get around to this, someday.

* cook and bake more often

Honestly, I think I did this less often than last year, and that's saying something.  I need to pick out some simple recipes and schedule my attempts to make them.  I am especially sad that I didn't try to make scrapple, this year, as I'd hoped to.

I still have the Joy of Cooking, which I got for Christmas last year and helped me feel good about making this resolution.

* be better about continually improving my software

I don't know... I'm certainly not anywhere near as good about it as I wanted to be.  I need to work on organizing my agenda better.  Keeping a real todo list seems impossible for me, as for many geeks.  I just can't find a planner that I like, be it hipster, RT, or Stickies.

So far, Stickies may be the best I've found so far.

That's it... I'll hopefully draw up my agenda for '06 before it gets here.
