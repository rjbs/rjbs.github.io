I think I've finished all the pages I meant to write for the Dist::Zilla
[Choose Your Own Tutorial](http://dzil.org/tutorial/start.html).  It covers a
bunch of Dist::Zilla topics like creating a new dist, converting an existing
one, and adding new behavior to your configuration.  The "choose your own"
format should make it easy to add new content, like a wiki, but I like the
almost-linear feel of the format.

I also really like being able to say that The Perl Foundation paid me to write
a Pod-based Choose Your Own Adventure system.

With this done, the only thing left to do is finish overhauling the way that
`dzil new` works!  I predicted this work could be done within a quarter (of a
year) and I think I'm definitely on track for that.
