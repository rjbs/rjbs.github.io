At the Greyhound station in Philadelphia where I catch my bus, there's an open wireless network.  Sometimes I use it to get a few quick messages off or to sync a few files before the long trip home.  Today, as we pulled out, we went in the opposite direction of the usual, and I saw a new network pop up as the old went out of range.  This made me think that it would be fun (for some values of "fun") to run MacStumbler on the way out of the city.  Right now we're a little over halfway out, at 30th Street Station, and I've already seen about sixty networks.  It makes me wish I had a GPS so that I could make a little map.  I don't think I'd have any use for it, but it would be neat.

I'm a little surprised how many people leave their access points named "linksys" or "Apple Network 12345" or "NETGEAR."  I wonder if setup wizards should more strongly suggest different names.  Then again, I guess nobody really cares.  If they did, I wouldn't always find computers named "Joe Smith's Computer."

Well, the bus driver just let us know that there's been some accident on the roads ahead, so I guess it's time to get to work on enjoying a long, long ride.
