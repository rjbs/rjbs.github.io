Leopard's ultra-easy screen sharing has made it a breeze to help my mom with her new Mac.  Today I used it for some more fun.  I created my first working Yahoo! pipe, a merging of my MJ photos and Gloria's.  Then I connected to my mom's computer with Leopard's excellent VNC client and subscribed her Mail.app to my new pipe feed.  I ran TextEdit and put a note on her desktop about what I'd done.

The whole operation took about ten minutes.  Awesome!
