I rented a pile of games today, including Star Wars: Clone Wars for GCN.  I've been letting the list of "games I want to play but not buy" get longer and longer, and it's time to get some names off the list.

I'm not a big Star Wars fan -- either of the movies /or/ the games.  The old movies are great, but everything since, say, Empire Strikes Back has been a little... meh.  Still, I got Rogue Leader with my GCN and I was pretty impressed with the graphics, so I thought I'd give all the new SW games a try.

The graphics in SWCW are even better.  Textures have more texture, lines are smoother, and things just look better.  There's a lot of haze and smoke in the first few missions, and it looks good.  I saw one or two framerate drops, but nothing that annoyed me.  The sound is fine.  It looks and sounds good, but not so much that I need to say much else.  While I would've wet myself for the game in '97, in 2003 it's nothing fantastic.

The basic plot is as follows: there are Clone Wars going on, and you need to, like, fight in them.  You shoot things, rescue people, defend things, fly around, and do other stuff.  I've been in a hover tank, a speeder, a starfighter, a troop transport, and on foor.  They all have different, but similar, controls.

At first, I thought the controls were pretty good.  They felt easy to use, but unlike a normal game.  That's good: I'm piloting a freaking hovertank, it /should/ feel weird.  It seemed pretty clear that figuring out just how the tank handled and how the controls could be exploited would be the key to success.  Unfortunately, once I got into every other scenario, the controls were pretty vanilla.  I guess they want to stay relatively consistant with the other SW games, but... I think my problem is that when you see the inside of these things, there are always about nine million buttons.  Meanwhile, I can control them with a joystick and four buttons, or five if I want to change perspective.

I don't feel like I'm Mace Windu.  If the game is going to let me live vicariously through Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker, I want to feel like I'm really them, dammit.  The on-foot missions are the weakest, so far.  There are just too many enemies at too close a range to feel like I'm not button-mashing.

So far, I've been playing at Padawan, the easy setting.  The missions were all cake-walks, which made it easy to see how things work.  Next up, I'm going to try the normal difficulty and see I start to need a strategy.
