Last night, just as I was shutting my lid, Ian sent me a message following up on something we'd talked about at the Kwiki BOF.  This reminded me that I'd said nothing about it.

After the last talk and before getting lost, Bryan and I went to a little BOF session on the new Kwiki.  It sounds like the new architecture is both scary and great, and I'm looking forward to upgrading the IQE swdev Kwiki and writing some plugins.  If I can help get some kind of configurable authorization working, I might see if I can get Kwiki as our intranet.  I think it's really the way to go.  I think I'm going to try to get to the new Kwiki talk later today.
