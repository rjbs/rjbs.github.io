Is it really so inconceivable that a smoker can go two hours without a cigarette?  If so, why aren't smokers more afraid of their own addiction? Anyway, that's not my problem.  My problem is that now the back of the bus smells like cigarette smoke, and I know the smell won't reach the front of the bus, so the driver won't do anything about it.

Busses need a Bonjour/Zeroconf-based system to allow passengers with laptops (or, alternately, who are me) to alert the driver that someone needs to be ejected from the bus.

Speaking of bus-based olfactory rudeness, I think it would be nice if more people would think about the smell of their food.  Eat and drink on the bus, if you like, but please don't eat something that will make me hungry or nauseous. Last night, one passenger was eating an Italian hoagie and another was eating (I'm pretty sure) stuffing.

It's enough to make me want to sit at the front of the bus.
