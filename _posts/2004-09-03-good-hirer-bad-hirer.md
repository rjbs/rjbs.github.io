I have spoken with people who seem really smart about how to hire, and also the opposite.  Names have been changed...

    <Glaucon> blogs are something I wish didn't exist.  They are so self important and worthless
    <Phaedo> Glaucon: oh, no doubt.
    <Glaucon> That is a weed-out question in interviews :)
    <Glaucon> "Do you have a blog?"  "yes"  "Thanks, we will contact you if you get the position"
    <rjbs> That's dumb.
    <Phaedo> I agree with rjbs.
    <rjbs> Most /people/ are self-important.
    <rjbs> "Are you a person?"  "Yes."  "Thanks, next!"
    <Glaucon> rjbs: well, my personal experience and number of people applying for
    good positions make weed out questions a must
    <Glaucon> gotta reduce the numbers.
    <Glaucon> most positions get 30-40 WELL qualified canidates

Right-o.
