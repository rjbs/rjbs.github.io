Back when I first started learning Perl 5, I was excited to find the [Perl
Advent Calendar](http://perladvent.pm.org/archives.html).  It was a series of
24 or so short articles about useful Perl modules or techniques, with one new
entry each day leading up to Christmas.  A few years later, the Catalyst crew
started the [Catalyst Advent
Calendar](http://www.catalystframework.org/calendar/2005).  I always liked the
Perl Advent Calendars, and kept meaning to contribute.  Every time, though
there were too many things I'd want to write about -- and mostly they were my
own code, so I felt sort of smarmy and self-promoting and never did it.

Finally, though, I'm glad to say I have tackled those feelings.  I will not shy
away from showing off my own code, and I will not worry about having to choose
just one thing.  This year, I will publish the [RJBS Advent
Calendar](http://advent.rjbs.manxome.org/), 24+ full days of cool, useful, or
stupid code that I have written and given as a gift to the rest of the CPAN
community.

I've had a lot of fun working on this project, and it's helped me find and fix
a number of little bugs or imperfections in the software I'll be talking about.

The first door opens in seven days.  I hope it's as fun to read as it was to
write.  No returns will be accepted.  Approximate actual cash value: $0.02
