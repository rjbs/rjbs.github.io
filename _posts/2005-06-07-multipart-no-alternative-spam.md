Dear Spammers,

I understand that you're in a hurry to convince me to buy C$ALIS SOFTTAB, apparently of the caucasian variety.  I know that you think that I will only be convinced if I see your picture of the tablets.

Still, maybe you could refrain from being rude to me when I read my mail with mutt.  Every time I open up spam and find, "Get a capable html e-mailer," I die a little bit inside.
