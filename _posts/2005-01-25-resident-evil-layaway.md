I have really been enjoying Resident Evil 4.  It is good.  I really like it.  I am going to buy it.

I can see how it would be nice to click "Keep It!" at gamefly.com and just keep the disc I have.  They'd even send me the original box.  It's still too expensive, though.  Instead, I figured I'd wait for it to get cheaper.  I can enjoy it later instead of now.

On IRC, Two-N-Dann from LVLUG said, "Well, it'll be in the bargain bin soon enough."  I chided him: "It'll be a while before it's really cheap."  He said it'd be $20 at Game Crazy within two months.  We have made a wager:  If the game is more than $20 on April 1, he will pay the difference.  If it's not, I pay him $20.  Given that Metroid Prime 2, released over two months ago, is still $35, I feel confident that I will be getting myself a $20 copy of RE4 in two months' time.
