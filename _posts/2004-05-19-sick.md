I've been sick.  I still feel pretty meh and tired.  I'll update this more later.  For now:

I am disappointed with my Bryar experiences, on many levels.  I think much of this may be more blog-general than Bryar-specific.  Some is not.

I am disappointed with my ability to sit down and get things done.

I am disappointed with Apple's customer service in the case of my sister's iBook.

I am very happy to have acquired nearly every episode of Farscape on DVD.

I'm pysched about a lot of the stuff that came out of E3.

I am being told I need to go to Wales soon, but I don't want to, but I probably will.  The situation there is annoying.

I still don't have an official approval to register for OSCON.
