I abandoned Verizon when MCI introduced The Neighborhood.  I'd long wanted unlimited long distance.  "Verizon," I said, "will you do that for me?"  They said, "No."

Immediately after I switched, they started mailing me and calling me, asking how they could get me back.  "Give me unlimited long distance for a flat fee," I said.  They said, "Well, no."

So, I was happy with MCI.  While the level of service I received declined, it was never anything less than Just Fine.  Finally, though, I had to switch back to Verizon.  Otherwise, Speakeasy couldn't give me faster DSL service.  I'm not sure what the awful reasoning is, but whatever.  I switched.  Verizon now has unlimited long-distance, so that's good.

Today, I got my welcome package.  It's addressed to "Richardo Signes."  Let me tell you something: nobody is named Richardo.  Every occurance of that name ever is a typographical error.  Sure, some people go through life with it, but only because the typo occured at birth or christening.  My name is not Richardo.  I was very clear about this with the CSR who signed me up.  "Oh, she said, I /had/ put an aich in there.  I've fixed it."

Nonetheless, today I got a bill for Richardo.  I called to report this, and navigated about five minutes of menus.  Then I got hold for five minutes.  Then I got a message, "We're too busy.  Call back later.  CLICK!"  It is not an exaggeration to say that I flung the phone against the wall.

I hope I don't have to talk to them again.  At least until it's to explain why I've switched back to some other provider with whom Speakeasy can now do business.
