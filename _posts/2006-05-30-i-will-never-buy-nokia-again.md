I recently bought a used Nokia 6620. For the most part, it's been a decent
phone. I can use it to make calls, get online, and play Frozen Bubble. It's had
a few quirks, though, which seem to affect my battery life. Also, I can't
reassign all of the buttons on it. I think these problems are caused by my
ancient firmware. In fact, I know some of them are: John as a newer version of
the firmware and can reprogram a number of the buttons that I can't.

I went to Nokia's web site to download newer firmware. I couldn't find it, so I
went to Google. Google found a number of forum posts indicating that only Nokia
can update a phone's firmware.

Irritated, but still determined, I went back to Nokia's site to find out what I
had to do. They had a service center locator, but all form submissions went to
a 404 error. I called them, today, and spoke with a CSR in the repair
department. First, she told me that I can't just get my software updated; they
won't flash it unless there's a problem. I told her about my issues and she
said that I could send it in for repairs. The downside: there was no guarantee
they'd flash my firmware, and there would be a minimum $100 charge. I asked
about local repair centers and she said, "We don't have 'authorized repair
centers,' and if we did, the same charge would apply."

"Okay," I said, "I'll throw it away and buy a Motorola, I guess." She didn't
care. (Big surprise.)

What this incident tells me is that if a Nokia phone gets better over time, an
early adopter can't benefit from those improvements. Further, a late adopter
can't benefit by buying a phone late in its life cycle, if that phone is old
stock. In other words, Nokia doesn't really care about their customer's
experience.

I think my plan is going to have to be only buy phones that have
user-installable firmware updates. I'll probably wait another year, though. I'm
not anxious to drop another hundred dollars on a phone any time soon.
