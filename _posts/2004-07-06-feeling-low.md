I can't get into specifics because the information is still somewhat confidential.  I'll post details in a few days.  For now, I will say this:  a co-worker of mine, whom I considered a friend, has left the company.  On his way out, he sent a nastygram claiming that my work was going to be the ruin of the company.

My motivation is shot.  I need a vacation.
