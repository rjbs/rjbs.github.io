I think that Get Satisfaction may be my absolute *least favorite place on the
internet*.  I have never visited it without ending up really angry.

Last time I was there, it was to report a bug in Darkslide.  I typed in my bug,
all the details, and so on, and then it popped up a new panel:  "just sign in
to file this bug!"  This should not have been a big deal, because it would
submit my login with my bug (I'd think) and then file it immediately.  I didn't
remember my password or have it on file, so I typed in my OpenID.  "Warning!
You're about to navigate away from a page with data in it!"  What?  Well,
logging in with OpenID doesn't seem to work that way.  I gave up on the bug
report, deleted Darkslide, and bought a competing product.

Today, I've been trying to report a bug in Fluid.  I was smarter:  I tried to
log in with my OpenID before filing the bug.  After getting my OpenID
confirmed, it said, "Great, now set up your account."  Oh... so OpenID isn't
enough, I need to connect it to a standard account... great.  Well, I entered
my email address and it complained that this address was in use.  I filed for
password recover, saved my password for future reference, and logged in.

I started to fill in the bug report form, and it said "this bug has a
**medium** chance of being responded to."  When I clicked the frowny face and
said the bug made me feel "confused," it went up to **high**.  Seriously?
What?

Fine.  I don't care.  I clicked "submit."

I give up, I should've stuck to my guns: if you use Get Satisfaction, I
probably do not want to use your product.
