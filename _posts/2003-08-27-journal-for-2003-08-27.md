## the new debug

Rather than continue to use the nice, pretty, stable Debug that I've been using for (wow!) a year and a half, I'm putting my current complete rewrite in place. Hopefully this will force me to work on it!

It's built on top of a few modules that are all relatively sensible, compared to the code in the previous Debug script.

Debug(.pm) fetches entries and pages and returns their coff-like content. Debug::Calendar outputs the calendar, complete with links.  It's subclassed into a few calendar types.  I'll try them out later.  Coff::Ghetto is a terrible, terrible coff parser that handles only headers and auto-paragraphing of text blocks.

There's a simple CGI script, then, that parses the request, puts those modules together, and outputs a result.  That's what you're looking at now.  Well, to be fair, it might be 2005 and you're reading this in yet another version.  As I write this, though, it's that CGI script that's in place.

I hope to get CSS working in it today, at which point it will become largely indistinguishable from the previous version.
