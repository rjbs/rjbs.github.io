I don't mean "the RPG" in general is dead.  I mean that the game I've been running, the ABE RPG, has come to an end.  We first met on October 15, 2005, meaning that the game ran for over three years.  Wow!

We had two PC deaths.  One PC died during the session after the player moved, and one died in the final game.  For the most part, this was pretty much the result of normal gameplay, and not the DM fudging the dice.  The PCs began as lowly smugglers and ended the game as slightly less lowly smugglers, but they had been caught up in massive interplanetary conspiracies.  They were in the right/wrong place at the right/wrong time.

All in all, I think the game was a lot of fun, but it was just colossal blunder after colossal blunder on my part as the DM.  I made numerous errors in developing the game setting, running the game sessions, and running the campaign.  I think it was still quite enjoyable, but it wasn't what I wanted it to be.

In January, we'll be starting a new campaign, using the fourth edition Dungeons and Dragons rules.  I think I have learned a lot, and I hope I can put it all to use in making a better game.

I also look forward to rolling dice other than ten siders.
