A [few](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-COG/)
[other](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-Ovid/)
[CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-ABH/)
[authors](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bundle-Theory/) have already uploaded
bundles that install all the modules they want to have around before they start
working.  This has always seemed like a good idea, but with all the
re-installing of perl I've been doing lately, it's finally hit home just how
much time I can save.

I've used [Task](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Task/)-style bundling instead of a
Bundle, but it's the same basic idea.  Now you can see what I'm most attached
to, if you care, with
[Task::BeLike::RJBS](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Task-BeLike-RJBS/).  Strangely
enough, there's only one email module in there, and very little related to the
web.  I guess familiarity breeds contempt after all.
