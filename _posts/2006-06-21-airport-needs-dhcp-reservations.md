Are you listening, Apple?  The Airport needs DHCP reservations.

I like my Airport, and I even feel like the cost wasn't so bad.  Sure, it cost more than its direct competitors, but it was absolutely trivia to get running. When I need to update it, it just takes a few seconds in a nice, simple GUI applications.  Other access points are easy, but Airport is effortless.

Well, except for one thing.  Airport takes care of port forwarding for me, which I only use for SubEthaEdit.  To forward ports, I just tell Airport what port should go from outside to an internal IP.  I tell it the IP.

Argh!  I don't want to have to worry about what IP my laptop is on.  I don't want to restart my AirPort every time I want to use SubEthaEdit (because my IP has changed and I'm updating its NAT rules).  I really don't want to use Mac OS's "network locations" crap to get around DHCP at home.

I just want to say: this MAC is my laptop, and should always get this IP, which has port forwarding set up.  That would make my life much, much easier at times when I want to use SubEthaEdit.  In fact, I'd probably use it a lot more!
