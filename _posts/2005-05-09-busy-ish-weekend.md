My hands are hurting quite a lot, again, lately, so I'll keep this brief.

We watched The Corporation, which was depressing, and made me feel once again that I need to work on avoiding supporting the evil overlords when I can help it.  We watched The Searchers, which was a tolerable western, but wasn't really very good.

We also saw Hitchhiker's Guide.  It was absolutely horrible.  Listen to the radio drama, see the BBC miniseries, or read the book.  Do not watch this movie.

We had dinner at Cracker Barrel on the way to pick up Jay from the airport.  I ate a lot, but it was mostly good.  I wonder where else in the world one finds breaded, fried steak.

Damion from the bike co-op called, and said that we can make up the missed material from our class next week.  That will be headsets, hubs, and spokes. That should be fun.
