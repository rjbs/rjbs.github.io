My new job is good.  I write code that makes it easier to write code, then I write that code.  Also, yesterday I did a full, productive day's work without ever putting on pants.

There is at least one thing I miss about my old job, though.  IQE had a number of Tektronix (and Xerox) Phaser printers.  They did good color and some ungodly number of pages per minute.  Today I am at my parents' place printing out lots of handouts for my upcoming RPG, and it is taking forever.
