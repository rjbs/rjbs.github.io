Am I a role-playing blogger?  Yes, obviously in the strictest interpretation of
the words, but do I get anybody following my blog's feed mostly to see my write
about RPGs?  I don't think so.  I think anybody doing so is probably chased off
by the technical posts... but there's little to no chance I'm going to try
maintaining two blogs.  Blech.

Anyway, a few weeks ago noism made a little list of [Things Role Playing
Bloggers Tend Not To Write
About](http://monstersandmanuals.blogspot.com/2011/11/trpbtntwas.html) and a
few people posted their thoughts on those topics, and I thought I might as well
do the same.

> Book binding. (I can't be the only person who bemoans the way new rulebooks
> tend to fall apart like a sheaf of dry leaves after about 5 seconds of use).

These days, I tend to buy two kinds of RPG books:  D&D 4E books, which are
pretty nicely bound, and PDFs.  I've bought PDFs lately of Rotworld, Labyrinth
Lord, Mutant Future, some Judge's Guild stuff, KC&C, and other rules, not to
mention a bunch of games that were available for free, like Mazes & Minotaurs,
Eclipse Phase, etc.  Even when these are available in print, lately, I'm opting
for PDF.

All of the small press or print on demand books that I've bought have been
decent (or better) quality.  I haven't suffered anything falling apart after
use, yet.  The thing is, it's often about the same price to have the PDF
printed at Staples and then spiral bound.  Spiral binding for RPG books, so
far, has been much better for me than stitched binding.  So far, the only books
I've found too hard to get spiral bound have been full-color books (which cost
an arm and a leg to print one-off) and digest-sized books, which Staples just
doesn't do.  Does anybody have a good source for those?  (And is there an
Encounter Critical PDF that puts one page per page, instead of the two-page
spreads that I have?)

> "Doing a voice". How many people "do voices"? Should they? How do you get
> better at "doing a voice" if that's your thing?

If I had to pick one thing that my players have liked over the years, it would
be NPC voices.  I don't know if they like anything else in my DM arsenal, but
NPC voices get mentioned a lot.  I always have fun with them, and a funny
voice can communicate a huge amount about the character without needing to
dedicate valuable table time to *actual* character development.  If the guy
sounds enough like Boris Badenov, the point is clear.

I've always liked doing funny voices, so I have no good advice.  [Jeff Rients'
post](http://jrients.blogspot.com/2011/11/things-to-talk-about.html) on these
questions mentioned listening to Billy West and John DiMagio talk about doing
voices, which seems like good advice.  They have a lot of interesting things to
say.  In fact, I've heard lots of voice actors say interesting things about how
they develop voice-only characterizations.  I can't say that I've intentionally
gone to them for advice, though.  I just goof around.

> Breaks. How often do you have breaks within sessions?

I dunno.  Once every two hours?  Any time someone really needs to use the
bathroom, or get a cigarette, or when I know that we haven't had a break in a
long time and I think a time-consuming 4E combat is going to begin soon, or
when we're out of drinks... which leads to:

> Alchohol at the table?

Sometimes we have a few beers.  Never more than two each, I think, because
never more than a six pack.  I don't think I've ever been in a game where we
wanted more than that.  Nobody wants to get all logey.  We can go out for
drinks on not-game-night for drinks.

> Description. Exactly how florid are your descriptions?

Not very.  I try to let the players imagine whatever they want – although my
sneaking suspicion is that for the most part nobody is working on forming a
coherent and detailed imagining of our games beyond what I say.  I try to keep
descriptions only as involved as the described thing is complex, and I try to
make sure that if there is one really important detail, there are at least a
few others to keep it from being too obvious.

If the sword is inscribed with the magic name that will control it, then there
will have to be a number of other embellishments: inlaid gems, a pommel in the
shape of a boar's head, etc.

> Where do you strike the balance between "doing what your character would do"
> and "acting like a dickhead"?

I have almost never had this problem, thankfully.  The PCs in my games are
usually pretty well set-upon, and fighting within the party is going to spell
disaster.  Even when the ship's captain (a PC) liked to harass the hired gun
(another PC) and get him into trouble, it never seemed like it would lead to
hard feelings – or a TPK.

I don't think I'd have any trouble telling a player to fall in line, if he was
making everyone else unhappy.  Who wants to have his leisure activity become a
big source of unhappiness?

> PC-on-PC violence. Do your players tend to avoid it, or do you ban it? Or
> does anything go?

I don't think it has *ever* happened.  Once or twice we had out-of-game mock
combats just to figure out how some rules worked, and this was usually fun, but
so far, no PvP.  I wouldn't mind player characters offing each other, as long
as nobody got too bent out of shape.  In my current 4E game, I think that, at
present, it would just be inconceivable.  (See my previous answer.)

I thought there were a few times in my space pirates game that the crew was
going to have to really mutiny, and if it had, I think there would've been one
night of grumbling, and then business as usual.  I don't think I'd ban it, but
if it started to become a regular event, and it was causing *player*
unhappiness, I guess I'd have to consider doing so.

I hadn't had to do this in a *long* time – doesn't everyone know D&D by now?
Well, no!  I was talking to my neighbors, who are in their late 20's, just last
week and said that I was off to a D&D game.  "What's that?"  I used Jeff R.'s
explanation:  It's like an old-timey radio serial, but instead of a script,
the actors improvise, and there are some rules for figuring out the results.
Later, my neighbor asked, "Did you win or did you die?"  I said, "I was the
referee."

If I can write the PC out of the session, I do.  Unfortunately, my games have
an ugly habit of ending *in media res*, so it's hard to extract one PC.  When
that happens I play the character, and have him or her keep quiet when
possible, and act reservedly in character when not.  I used to also run them in
combat, but lately I hand them over to the other players, and so far this
hasn't resulted in any real problems.

The only way I'd let the absent PC's character die is if there was a TPK.
Other than that, I think it's just not fair.

When I started my current 4E game, my goal was that whenever a player could not
attend, I would run a side game with different characters, set in distant part
of history that would inform the rest of the game, but not really affect it.

I was really happy with that, but it ended up happening too often.  We tried to
play every 3 weeks, but half the time it would get delayed a week, and that
would mean something like two months between any two main-story games.  My
players, wonderful guys though they are, don't have the best memory for what
happened from session to session, and putting more time between the main story
sessions was a problem.

I'd love to do it again, though, with a more regularly-scheduled game.
