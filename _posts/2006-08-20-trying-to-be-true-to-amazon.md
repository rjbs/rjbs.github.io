I really try to buy things locally whenever reasonable.  I'm willing to pay a
fairly substantial premium to do so, because I like to support my town.  That
said, Amazon gets a lot of my business.  They have a lot of things that it's
hard to get locally, we have no local bookstores that I consistentlylike
shopping with, and Amazon Prime makes it feel like there's never any shipping
tax on my orders.

Today, I wanted to order some new hardware for doing SuperDuper! backups of our
laptops.  I had a $50 gift certificate, so I had to shop with Amazon (or, I
think, a partner; it's hard to tell, but zShops at least were out).  When I
searched for things, I kept finding stuff listed at one price that then showed
up at another when I clicked on the search result.  Why?  The search listed the
cheapest price, but the main price listed on the item's page was the Amazon
price.  Now things got confusing: for me, the Amazon price was exact, as I
would pay no shipping.  For other vendors, I'd have to go figure out shipping.
For yet others, I would not be able to use my gift certificate.  Without the
gift certificate, I'd be better off using Newegg, from whom I buy hardware most
often.

Eventually I got things sorted:  I ordered a hard drive enclosure from
TigerDirect via Amazon with my certificate, but had to pay shipping.  That left
me with about seven dollars on the certificate, so I looked into getting some
cables I needed.  All the search results were coming up showing a few bucks,
but the Amazon item price would be $20.

I really want to do business with Amazon, not their little remoras.  While I
like the fact that those symbiotic partner stores are there for me, sometimes I
just want to force the Amazon product search engine to only show me "from
Amazon" results.

It's a shame that I do not really have All My Email Ever.  I would have my
original receipt for my first few Amazon purchases, with the ancient logo and
everything.  I think I ordered them with the Lynx browser.  At least I can pull
up the records of the order.  Chip might be proud:
