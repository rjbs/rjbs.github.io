<h4>dvd-rw</h4>Right, so I got a DVD burner from Lacie.  I coastered my first DVD, which was not pleasant.  I burned a CD's to make sure the darn thing worked, and that went alright.  Gloria gave me a lift to Staples where I picked up a few blanks. I burned some archives, but when I went to burn my homedir, it coastered.  Or, at least it seemed to.  Despite the error message and too-short burn time, it looks like I burned everything I needed to.

This kinda sucks.  I don't to "try again," because it's two bucks a pop when I burn a coaster.  I need a clever way to at least test if I burned my backup correctly.

Also, I labelled it 2003-03-25 instead of 2004-03-25.<h4>harvest moon</h4>I picked up Harvest Moon.  So far, I think my farmer is going to die of starvation.
