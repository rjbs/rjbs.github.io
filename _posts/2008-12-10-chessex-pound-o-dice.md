We need new dice for our D&D game.  I ordered a Chessex Pound-o-Dice from an
Amazon vendor, Rookie's HQ Games and Cards.  Here's what we got:

* 7 die set, pale pink with green numbers and orange speckles
* 11 d4,  various styles
*  8 d6,  numbered, normal size, various styles
* 12 d6,  pipped, normal size, various styles
*  1 d6,  pipped, slightly oversize, solid indigo
*  1 d6,  pipped, slightly undersize, translucent green
* 14 d6,  pipped, tiny, various styles
*  7 d6,  pipped, tiny, various styles, drilled for stringing
*  4 d6,  pipped, miniscule, green, drilled for stringing
*  4 d8,  various styles
* 23 d10, ones-place, various styles
*  5 d10, tens-place, various styles
*  4 d10, unmarked, marbled (three red/black, one green/black)
*  1 d10, unmarked, sparkly
*  6 d12, various styles
*  1 d12, slightly oversize, solid red, numbered 0 - 10 and star
* 15 d20, all speckled and regular

The very small and unmarked dice are basically useless.  I will probably throw
away the very small ones.  Even those that are not drilled do not seem regular
enough to roll properly, and their size makes them novelties, anyway.

I have no idea whether anyone has a use for unmarked d10s.  I suppose I could
paint a label on them, or something, but that's not going to happen.

I don't mind the distribution I got, although a few more numbered d6s would've
been nice.  I'll probably buy more, once I review what kind of dice I'm going
to need most often.  I'm also a bit disappointed that the single vs. double
digit d10 disparity is so high.

I wonder what the purpose of that weird d12 is.  I wonder whether D&D 4th
Edition uses d12 as rarely as 1st edition did.  I seem to recall it was
basically used for ranger hit dice and halberd damage.

Quite a few of the d10s were of a style I'd never seen before.  One half of the
die was one color, and the other was a different color.  They color change
along the middle of the die.  I like them, and would probably buy more in that
style if I was a die collector.

I consider the Pound-o-Dice a success.  If I need more dice (without
specificaly needing a lot of one type) I will definitely get another pound.
