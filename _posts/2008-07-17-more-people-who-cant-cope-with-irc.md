If you can't handle even this light amount of attitude, you probably should
stick to ... I don't know what.  Support from consultants?

    <jbarton> i have a question about the usage of $c->views and $c->view
    <@rjbs> purl: ask to ask
    <purl> Don't ask to ask.  Just ask!  If no one answers, then rest assured 
           it's because no one knows the answer. or perhaps no one likes you 
           enough to bother answering
    <jbarton> i didnt ask to ask
    <jbarton> i am typing my question out
    <@rjbs> Ok.  Announcing that you are about to ask is just a variation on 
            a theme. ;)
    <jbarton> not really
    <@mst> yes really.
    <jbarton> i was giving context
    <jbarton> well arent you a bunch of assholes, nevermind then
    <@rjbs> Ok, finish preparing your question and ask it.
