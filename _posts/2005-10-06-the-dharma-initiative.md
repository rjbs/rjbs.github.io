Last night, the phrase "dharma initiative" appeared on Lost.  I immediately whoised and googled it, and found nothing interesting.  There were a lot of links to Hindu sites.

Within about an hour, the Google results changed: the site search was the same, but now there was an ad to buy season one of Lost from Amazon.  Nice reaction time.

So, Amazon ad purchaser: I salute you.
