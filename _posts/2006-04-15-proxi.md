This looks sort of neat: it lets you build automator-like actions and assign them to different kinds of triggers like keypresses or mouse gestures.  I'm afraid that it will lack the ability to usefully script things I want to do, that it won't talk to Growl, and that it will stagnate when it's abandoned and its source is never released.

Yeah, I'm still bitter about LiteSwitch X.
