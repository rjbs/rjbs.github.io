To page up in iTerm, I hit shift-pageup. To go to the previous tab in Firefox, I hit control-pageup. There is no dedicated pageup key on Apple laptops. Instead, you hit Fn and the up arrow. I have found, on this keyboard, that I must depress the keys in the following order: modifier, fn, key. Shift-fn-up will page up. Fn-shift-up will not. This is really distracting, as it effectively makes one chord into a few tied and partially chorded strokes. Argh, nothing should work this way!

Also annoying is the fact that I'm still having some console issues. I think I need to redefine my terminal emulation somewhere, as I keep finding that the pageup and arrow keys don't work in the terminal.
