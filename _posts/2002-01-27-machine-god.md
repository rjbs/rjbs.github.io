Born in the summer of 1998, the Church of the Machine God was a proud but
short-lived venture undertaken by Brothers OT (that's me),
[Kevin](/blog/2002/01/kevin/), Søren, and Drew.

It all began when Kevin and I finally decided that we'd get an apartment after
our leases expired.  Until September '98 he was in an overpriced studio in
Allston and I was in a free but mouse-infested Boston University apartment.  As
summer wore on, we began to plan for the setup and rules of our apartment.  (We
had secured the lease sometime in July, if memory serves me right.)  Chief in
our designs was the idea of a decent LAN and a good A/V setup.  We had some
NICs and a hub, but we needed more.  Like any good Bostonian geeks, we made the
rounds at the <a href='http://web.mit.edu/w1mx/www/swapfest.html'>MIT Flea</a>,
where all manner of hardware could be had cheap.

Between a few hundred dollars at the flea and generous donations or sales by
friends, we managed to assemble a decent system in the house:

### living room

* six 20" televisions (five worked, one was a 1960's motorola that just looked great)
* a tiny 4" combination TV/radio which never worked
* two VHS VCR's
* a betamax VCR
* a DVD player
* a laserdisc player which was twitchy but operable
* a pentium/75 (gregory-thaumaturgus)
* a 50 CD jukebox

### kitchen

* a 13" television
* a VT202

### library

* a 486/66 (john)

After a month, or so, in the apartment, Kevin and I bought a new, 36"
flat-screen Panasonic television with two-tuner picture-in-picture.  This
television, The Good Book, became the centerpiece of the living room, and the
focus of much adoring worship (for so we called our slavish devotion to cable
TV and console gaming.)

The idea was, in the end, to create an intranet application that would let you
use <a href='http://www.tvguide.com'>TV Guide online</a> listings to program
any of the house's common TV's or VCR's.  There were numerous setbacks, though.
The biggest was that none of us knew enough of any decent programming language
to write the application to do it.  (S&oslash;ren was somewhat proficient in
JavaScript, but not enough at that point.)  Another crippling factor was our
inability to find any good information on how to build a computer-controller
remote control.

Failing these two essentials, we instead just watched a lot of TV and played a
lot of Nintendo.  Our games of choice were 007: Goldeneye and MarioKart 64>.
(There was also a Playstation, but it was used mostly for FF7 and then left
alone.)  One television was mostly devoted to the <a
href='http://www.historychannel.com'>History Channel</a> and known as The Nazi
Television because of History's then-policy of "all WWII, all the time."

The LAN went up almost before we had any furniture, and was used almost
exclusively for playing [StarCraft](http://www.blizzard.com/starcraft) over
IPX.  There was no high-speed internet in our area and neither Kevin nor I felt
the urge to set up IP masquerading to share a 56k connection, so there was,
instead, a fifty foot telephone cable that was always running to one of our
rooms for network connections.  For a long time, that was our only line, and it
led to many, many busy signals for our friends and family.

Shortly after Kevin died and Søren left (these happened within days of each
other), Drew moved in.  We quickly set up a shared dial-up and a second phone
line, but as this part of the Machine God grew toward fruition, the greater
parts faded away.  We sold or gave away several of the A/V componants to make
money and room, and soon had only two televisions in the living room.

Now, with none of the original Brotherhood still residing together and the
pieces of the Machine God scattered to the four winds, only the dream remains
alive -- the dream that someday we may all have so many televisions that we
can't even think of a reason to turn some of them on.  (The Good Book lives,
too.  It's still with me, and still an object of great charisma.  After all,
it's connected to the GameCube!)
