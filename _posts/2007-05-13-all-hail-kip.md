I've been wanted to get rid of the stupid concrete walkway in my back yard ever
since (or before) we moved in.  Last week I found a local place that does
concrete recycling.  I mentioned this to Kip and asked if, at some unspecified
time in the future, he'd give me a hand getting rid of the walkway.

Today, he came by to look and see what we'd need to do.  Then he said, "Let's
do it!"  He got a rock hammer and pick-axe-like tool from his truck and we laid
waste to the damned thing.  I'm a real weakling, and have no clue how to
perform most types of manual labor, so Kip did most of the real work.  It was a
sort of pathetic that he'd break the blocks with one or two hammer strokes, but
it would take me ten or fifteen.

It was great to get done, and I enjoyed, as I usually do, doing some actual
work.  Next up: haul away the concrete and fill in the trench.
