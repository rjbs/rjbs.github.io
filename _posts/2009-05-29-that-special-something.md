Clearly there is something to the notion of star power.  I'm half-watching the movie Lifeforce for the first time and thought, "Boy, that guy *really* reminds me of Mr. Deltoid, a minor character in a movie I haven't seen for 15 years or so."

It turns out I was right.  Both are played by Aubrey Morris, who apparently had a pretty big acting career, including roughly nothing else I've seen apart from the BBC HHGG.  He is pretty great, though.  If I had to have one of those pretentious "accents" that foreigners insist on using, I would not mind having his.
