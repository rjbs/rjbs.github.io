According to the latest TiVo News emailling, "we are targeting mid-2006 for Mac support for TivoToGo(TM)!)"  This will make me very happy, and make me feel much better about not building a MythTV.  I hope they hit that target.  It may make bus rides less boring, even though it will give me a way to avoid reading.
