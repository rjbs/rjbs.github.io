I decided that rather than sit around on my butt, I should to try to get some fresh air and go cycling.  So, I went out and rode over toward Allentown.  I thought about picking up a botle of vermouth, but I'd left my Timbuk2 at home.

So, I turned around and headed home.  At the top of the hill at the intersection of Center and New, though, I lost control.  I'm not sure how.  I remember thinking, immediately afterward, that it should have been pretty embarassing, but now I don't remember why.  Anyway, I wiped out and scraped the crap out of my right arm.  So, in a lot of pain, I cruised over to work and washed my wound, and Anita and Keith helped me get bandaged up.  Leaving, I realized that my rear wheel had bent and was no longer true.  Every half turn it knocked against the rear brake pad.

I walked home and finished washing up.  I figure I'll take my bike over to Genesit to get its wheel trued this week sometime.  Even with a maintenance manual on its way, I don't feel like messing around with my spokes.

Strangely enough, though, I feel better in general, now.  Go figure!
