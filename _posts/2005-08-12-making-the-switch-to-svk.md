Well, those long paths were too much for me.  It's not that I had to type them much... I just kept thinking about them.  This morning, I couldn't enjoy my yogurt, dreading the thought of having to type that huge svn+ssh URL again.  Is it pathetic that my main reason for trying this way powerful svn client was to avoid typing long URL's?  Yeah, maybe.  I don't care!

I've read through a few basic tutorials, and I have my main repositories mirrored to my laptop.  I branched my code repository, and I played around with checking things in and out.  Everything has been relatively simple and straightforward.  I'll tell you one thing, though:  I don't understand why all the docs talk about smerge instead of push/pull.  It seems like the people I've asked all use push and pull.  smerge takes longer to type, because you have to type big URLs again.  Its actual function seems a bit complicated compared to push and pull.  I guess that if you're working on a very active project with potential for conflict, smerge is useful.  For me, pull and push seem like the "local branch of local mirror of remote repo" version of update and commit, and that makes my little brain happy.

I remember thinking, last year when HP gave me a really crappy USB memory stick, that it would be useful to put an svk mirror on it.  Now that Intel has given me a nicer USB memory stick and I am actually using svk, I see no reason to do that, unless I have to go somewhere and code without my laptop, but with a computer with svk.  Err.

I am still at a loss as to what kind of data I should put on that thing.  I think the only really useful thing might be a copy of PuTTY and my private key. Suggestions welcome.
