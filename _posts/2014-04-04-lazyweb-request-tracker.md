I like using [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/).  It's a to
do list tracker.  I use it for lots of little one-off tasks (blog ideas, games
to try) and for simple projects that don't have GitHub repositories.  It's got
an API (which is kind of weird) and an iOS app (which is very good) and a bunch
of other interesting little services.

I'd like to use it for more things.  Most of them would be a little tough to
do, because of the particulars of RTM.  Today, though, I realized a useful
thing to do:  every time I think, "I wonder how I can do XYZ?" and tweet it,
I'll also put it [in a list in
RTM](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/rjbs/36128446/).  Then if I get an
answer, I can record it, and if I don't, I can remember what I was looking for
and ask again later.  Or maybe figure out a solution on my own!
