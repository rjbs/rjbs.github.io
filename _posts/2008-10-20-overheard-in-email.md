Programming email can leave you a bit ... touched.  Here are some recent gems
from `#email` on irc.perl.org

    <dave0> To bounce, or not to bounce
    <dave0> that is the question
    <dave0> whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    <dave0> the slings and arrows of outrageous NDRs
    <dave0> or by opposing, end them

It's a poetry contest he wants, is it?

    <rjbs> what a piece of work is mime
    <rjbs> how nested in structure
    <rjbs> how infinite in quirkiness
    <rjbs> in form and encoding how completely execrable
    <rjbs> the paragon of feature creep
    <rjbs> and yet to me
    <rjbs> what is the quintessence of wtf

Have we gone too far?  No.

    <confound> well, writing a poem about mime is pretty wtf
    <dave0> I think a poem about MIME would need to be something epic and 
            full of angry, capricious Norse gods
    <rjbs> multipart/epicpoem
    <rjbs> Das MIMErd√§mmerungenlied
    <rjbs> stanza*1*=latin-1'q'no_no'Das=20MIMErd=E4mmerungenlied
    <dave0> ; format=opera

Trust us.  It's hilarious.
