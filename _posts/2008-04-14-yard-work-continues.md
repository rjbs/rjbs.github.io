Yesterday, Kip (and the rest of his clan) came over and we finished Phase II of
[Project Better Back
Yard](http://flickr.com/photos/rjbs/sets/72157600335577475/).  I'd already dug
up quite a bit of the earth around the two posts.  I was "thrilled" to find
that just beside the post nearer the house, there was *another* post!  It had
probably been cut off before the still-there post was planted, but I was still
gobsmacked.  It had a much more reasonable base, only a few inches across, and
the concrete was awful.  I broke out most of it with a hand sledge.

Kip estimated that each concrete anchor for the remaining posts would weigh
about four hundred pounds, and guessed that trying to remove them was just
asking for trouble.  I agreed.  We dug out a small trench beside each anchor
and laid them sideways and buried them about a foot underground.  I'll have to
make a note, on the deed, that future owners should beware.  Maybe I'll just
make a treasure map and hide it in the cistern in an antique scroll case.

Anyway, now the back yard is not totally flat, but it's all soil and grass on
top, so the next step is to get a roto tiller, turn everything over, flatten
everything out, and lay down new grass and plants.  Hopefully that will happen
in two weeks and then we'll have a yard that MJ can run around in and that
won't be the second-worst eyesore among all the shared yards in our lot.
