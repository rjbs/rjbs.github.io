I've gotten some mileage out of Facebook.  I caught up with a few old friends,
whom I otherwise would've never heard from.  That's about it.  I actually
appreciate that a lot, but the rest of Facebook can really just go to Hell.

First off, there's the fact that it doesn't seem to want to play well with
others.  I can't use my OpenID, I can't get an RSS feed of anything, and I
can't *really* shut off most of the obnoxious "your friend just took a quiz!"
alerts.

I can't convince non-technically-minded people that no, Facebook is not email.
I keep getting email from Facebook telling me I have a message from someone
else who has my email address.  Has Facebook become "The Internet" to some
people?  Ugh.

It could be worse, though.  I could just be getting "pokes."  Oh, or
"super-pokes."  This is a new kind of electronic communication whereby a friend
whom you haven't heard from in years sends you an email, but without any
content.  Instead you get a little message bar saying, "Long Lost Friend has
sent you a Beer.  Click here to send one back!"  Dude, you know what?  Why
don't you send me an *email* and I will buy you a *real* beer and we can eat
some tacos.  This "poke" stuff is rubbish.

Today and a few weeks ago, I logged in and saw a quiz that a friend wanted me
to take.  Normally I ignore these, but these two were both sort of interesting
and related to my friendship with this person.  Having gone throught the quiz,
I was then asked to "pick 20 friends to send this to."  There was a "Skip"
button, but clicking it brought up the error, "You must pick 20 friends."
Great.

I am not a huge fan of using Google for all my data needs, but I do have hopes
for the [Social Graph API](http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/) as a long
overdue means to show people that friendship network data need not live in
these walled city ghettos like Facebook, MySpace, Orkut, or, God save us,
Xanga.
