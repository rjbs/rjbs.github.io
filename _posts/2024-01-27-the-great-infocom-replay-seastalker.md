Okay, I'm not going to really play Seastalker.

I tried, and found it fairly insufferable.  I'm not doing this for science or
a deep research purpose.  It's for fun, and this isn't fun.  From the very
beginning, I had a bad feeling about this.

This was bad enough.  But then this happened over and over:

So many things were "go look at the feelies".  I have images of the feelies,
but what a drag.  It wasn't fun, it didn't look interesting, I put it aside.

Next up is [Cutthroats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutthroats_(video_game))
— also nautical themed, so I'm wary.  On the other hand, it's by Michael
Berlyn, who wrote Suspended, a favorite of mine.  (Then again, I noped out of
his other game Infidel.  We'll see how it goes.)
