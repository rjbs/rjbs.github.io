Today, I got a package from a bookstore in Brooklyn.  It contained a copy of Shadows Over Baker Street, a collection of stories about Sherlock Holmes's encounters with Cthulhu and the other Elder Gods.  I did not order this book, although I wanted it.  It was delivered to "Ric Signes."

I am so confused!  Who are you? I would like to thank you.
